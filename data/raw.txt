Answer: B
This question requires us to use Bayes’ Formula for updated probability.
We have to find P (weekend | failure).
We are given the following information:
P (weekday) = 0.69
P (weekend) = 0.31
P (pass | weekday) = 0.52
P (pass | weekend) = 0.63
We can infer the following:
P (fail | weekday) = 1 − P (pass | weekday) = 1 – 0.52 = 0.48
P (fail | weekend) = 1 – P (pass | weekend) = 1 − 0.63 = 0.37
P (fail) P(fail|weekday) P (weekday) P(fail|weekend) P(weekend)

Questions 33–44 relate to Economics
33 An increase in the price of Product B leads to an increase in demand for Product A. Product A
and Product B are most likely:
A. Inferior goods.
B. Substitute goods.
C. Supernormal goods.
Answer: B
The increase is price of Product B results in an increase in demand for Product A. The cross
elasticity of demand for these two products is positive. Therefore, they are substitutes.
34. A firm operates in perfect competition. Given that price lies between average variable cost and
average total cost, the firm’s short-run and long-run operating decisions will most likely be:
Short Run Long Run
A. Continue to operate Exit market
B. Continue to operate Continue to operate
C. Shut down Exit market
Answer: A
When price lies between AVC and ATC, the firm will remain in production in the short run, as it
meets all variable costs and covers a portion of its fixed costs.
To remain in business in the long run, the firm must break even or cover all costs, so price must at
least equal ATC.

35. The lowest point on the long-run average cost curve is most likely known as the firm’s:
A. Minimum efficient scale.
B. Maximum efficient scale.
C. Econometric scale.
Answer: A
The minimum point on the LRAC curve is referred to as the minimum efficient scale. The
minimum efficient scale is the optimal firm size under perfect competition over the long run.
36. Increasing and decreasing marginal returns to labor most likely explain the U‐shape of the:
A. Short-run marginal cost curve.
B. Long-run average cost curve.
C. Short-run total product curve.
Answer: A
• Changes in marginal returns to a variable factor of production are the reason behind the
U‐shape of the marginal cost curve and SR average cost curve.
• The U‐shape of the long-run average cost curve is explained by economies and
diseconomies of scale.
• The total product curve is not U‐shaped. It initially increases at an increasing rate and
then only increases at a decreasing rate.
37. Which of the following is most likely regarding the Stackelberg oligopoly model?
A. Firms in the industry make their decisions sequentially.
B. None of the firms in the industry can increase profits by unilaterally changing its price.
C. All firms in the industry are interdependent.
Answer: A
In contrast to the Cournot model (which assumes that decision‐making is simultaneous), the
Stackelberg model (also known as dominant firm, or top dog model) assumes that decision‐
making is sequential.
Under this model, the dominant firm can increase its profits by unilaterally increasing its price
(unlike Nash equilibrium). Further, the dominant firm is independent, while all other firms take
their cue from the actions of the dominant firm.

38. The difference between total value to buyers and total variable cost of producers is most likely
known as:
A. Consumer surplus.
B. Producer surplus.
C. Total surplus.
Answer: C
• The difference between total value to buyers and total variable cost of producers
represents total surplus (the sum of consumer and producer surplus).
• Consumer surplus is the difference between the total value that consumers place on units
purchased and the total cost of purchasing them.
• Producer surplus is the difference between total revenue and total variable cost.
39. If economic data suggest that the economy is undergoing an expansion caused by an increase in
aggregate demand (AD), investors should least likely increase their investments in:
A. Cyclical companies.
B. Commodity-oriented companies.
C. Defensive companies.
Answer: C
If economic data suggest that the economy is undergoing an expansion caused by an increase in
AD, going forward corporate profits will be expected to rise, commodity prices will be expected
to increase, interest rates will be expected to rise, and inflationary pressures will build in the
economy. Therefore, investors should:
• Increase investments in cyclical companies as their earnings would rise significantly in
this scenario.
• Increase investments in commodities and/or commodity‐oriented companies.
• Reduce investments in defensive companies, as their profits would not rise as
significantly as those of cyclical companies.

48. An analyst gathered the following information about a company that follows U.S. GAAP for a
given year:
Beginning shareholders’ equity $1,350,000
Net income $250,000
Dividends declared $75,000
Dividends paid $85,000
Ending shareholders’ equity $1,575,000
The company’s comprehensive income for the year is closest to:
A. $50,000.
B. $300,000.
C. $60,000.
Answer: B
Beginning shareholders’ equity + Net income + Other comprehensive income – Dividends
declared = Ending shareholders’ equity.
Other comprehensive income = 1,575,000 + 75,000 – 250,000 − 1,350,000 = 50,000
Comprehensive income = Other comprehensive income + Net income = $300,000

49. Assume U.S. GAAP holds. An analyst gathered the following information about a company for a
given year:
$m
Net income 12.5
Depreciation 1.25
Amortization 0.5
Interest expense 3
Net capital expenditure 1.75
Dividends paid 0.25

Tax rate 35%
Free cash flow to the firm for the year is closest to:
A. $13.3m.
B. $13.05m.
C. $9.4m.
Answer: A
FCFF = NI + NCC + [Int × (1 − t)] − FC Inv − WC Inv
FCFF = 12.5 + 1.75 + [3 × (1 − 0.35)] − 1.75 − 1.15 = $13.3m
50. Which of the following is least likely regarding the classification of various items on the cash
flow statement under IFRS and U.S. GAAP?
IFRS U.S. GAAP

the original amount recognized
Permitted, but only to the extent of a
previously recognized write‐down
C. Not permitted Not permitted
© Wiley 2017 All Rights Reserved. Any unauthorized copying or distribution will constitute an infringement of copyright.94
Answer: A
For companies that are not engaged in mining or agricultural activities:
• U.S. GAAP prohibits the reversal of any inventory write‐down.
• IFRS permits a reversal to the extent of the write‐down that had been previously
recorded.
52. Consider the following statements:
Statement 1: In the first year of a company’s operations, FIFO and LIFO will result in the same
amount for cost of goods available for sale if prices have been declining over the year.
Statement 2: In a period of falling prices, use of LIFO will enable a firm to retain more cash.
Which of the following is most likely?
A. Both statements are incorrect.
B. Only Statement 1 is incorrect.
C. Only Statement 2 is incorrect.
Answer: C
• Cost of goods available for sale is the sum of opening inventory and purchases. In the
first year of a company’s operations, the inventory cost flow assumption has no impact on
the amount recognized as cost of goods available for sale.
• In a period of falling prices, use of LIFO will result in lower COGS, higher net income,
higher taxes, and lower cash.
53. A company’s management wishes to report higher earnings for the next few years. In order to
accomplish this, management will most likely:
A. Increase the asset’s useful life estimate and the estimated salvage value.
B. Increase the asset’s useful life estimate and reduce the salvage value estimate.
C. Increase the estimated salvage value and reduce the useful life estimate.
Answer: A
In order to report higher earnings, a company must recognize lower depreciation expense. This
is accomplished by increasing the asset’s useful life estimate and increasing the salvage value
estimate.

54. Consider an asset whose carrying amount was revalued downwards in 2014. In 2015, if the value
of the asset is revised upwards, the impact on reported leverage and return on equity will most
likely be:
Reported Leverage Return on Equity
A. Improves Falls
B. Worsens Increases
C. Improves Increases
Answer: C
Under the revaluation model (IFRS), if the upward revaluation is reversing a previous downward
revaluation, the gain flows through the income statement (to increase net income) and then
increases shareholders’ equity. If the upward revaluation is not reversing a previous downward
revaluation, the gain flows through the revaluation surplus and increases shareholders’ equity
directly.
• In 2015, assets increase along with shareholders’ equity so reported leverage ratios
improve (decrease).
• The return on equity also increases as net income and shareholders’ equity both increase.
The numerator effect dominates and results in an increase in the ratio.
55. A company reports income tax expense of $25,000. During the year it reports a decrease in
deferred tax liabilities of $12,500 and an increase in deferred tax assets of $5,000. The company’s
taxes payable for the year are closest to:
A. $42,500.
B. $7,500.
C. $17,500.
Answer: A
ITE = TP + Change in DTL − Change in DTA
TP = $25,000 − (–$12,500) + $5,000 = $42,500
56. Which of the following sources of changes in the net pension asset/liability is most likely to be
recognized in other comprehensive income?

57. Under the effective interest method, a company that issues zero-coupon bonds will least likely
report:
A. A decrease in its debt‐to‐assets ratio each year over the term of the bonds.
B. A higher cash outflow from financing activities upon maturity than the inflow recorded under
financing activities upon issuance.
C. No related cash outflows from operating activities for any period during the bond’s term.
Answer: A
A company that issues zero-coupon bonds basically issues them at a deep discount to par. The
book value of the liability increases each year over the term and approaches the bonds’ par value.
Therefore, the company’s reported debt‐to‐assets ratio will increase each year.
58. ABC Corp. purchases a milling machine. The company considers the machine’s rotating cutter
to be a significant component. Which of the following is least likely an additional estimate that
the company will be required to make if it depreciates the milling machine using the component
method instead of depreciating it as a whole?
A. Useful life of milling machine
B. Useful life of cutter
C. Portion of residual value attributable to cutter
Answer: A
ABC would need to estimate the useful life of the milling machine regardless of whether it
chooses to depreciate it using the component method or not. However, the company would be
required to estimate the useful life and residual value of the cutter (component) only if it plans to
use the component method.

59. Which of the following is most likely regarding finance costs incurred during the construction of
an asset:
A. Under U.S. GAAP they must be capitalized, while under IFRS companies may choose to
capitalize these costs.
B. These costs must be capitalized under both U.S. GAAP and IFRS.
C. Under IFRS they must be capitalized, while under U.S. GAAP companies may choose to
capitalize these costs.
Answer: B
• Finance costs incurred during construction of an asset must be capitalized under
U.S. GAAP and IFRS.
60. A company owns a machine that is carried at $6,000. It estimates that the machine will yield
future cash flows amounting to $5,200, and that the present value of these cash flows is $4,700.
The fair value of the machine is believed to be $4,800, while selling costs would total $200. The
amount of impairment charged against this asset under IFRS and U.S. GAAP would be closest to:
IFRS U.S. GAAP
A. $1,300 $800
B. $1,400 $1,300
C. $1,300 $1,200
Answer: C
IFRS: Compare carrying amount ($6,000) to recoverable amount, which equals the higher of fair
value less costs to sell ($4,800 – $200 = $4,600) and value in use ($4,700). Impairment charge
equals ($6,000 – $4,700 = $1,300).
U.S. GAAP:
Asset is impaired if carrying value exceeds recoverable amount, which equals the total value of
undiscounted cash flows expected from the asset.
To measure the impairment loss, compare carrying amount ($6,000) to fair value ($4,800).
Impairment charge equals ($6,000 – $4,800 = $1,200).
61. On January 1, 2008, Alpha Manufacturers purchased a machine for $2.5 million. For accounting
purposes, the asset is depreciated on a 10% straight‐line basis. For tax purposes it is depreciated
on a 15% straight‐line basis. On January 1, 2009, the machine is revalued at $2.6 million and it is
estimated that the machine will be used for a further 25 years after revaluation. For tax purposes,
the revaluation is not recognized.

Given a tax rate of 40% and that the machine has zero salvage value for tax and financial
reporting purposes, the deferred tax asset or liability on December 31, 2009, is closest to:
A. $158,400.
B. $50,000.
C. $298,400.
Answer: A
Depreciation expense for accounting purposes = 2,500,000 × 10% = $250,000
Depreciation expense for tax purposes = 2,500,000 × 15% = $375,000
Carrying amount on December 31, 2008 = 2,500,000 − 250,000 = $2,250,000
Tax base on December 31, 2008 = 2,500,000 − 375,000 = $2,125,000
Revaluation = 2,600,000 – 2,250,000 = $350,000
Carrying amount on December 31, 2009 = 2,600,000 − (2,600,000 / 25) = 2,496,000
Tax base on December 31, 2009 = 2,125,000 – 375,000 = $1,750,000
Reduction in revaluation surplus = 350,000 × 40% = $140,000
Deferred tax liability = [(2,496,000 − 1,750,000) × 40%] − 140,000 = $158,400
62. An analyst gathers the following information about a company:
Inventory turnover 14 times

If the company’s net operating cycle equals 15 days, the company’s number of days of payables
is closest to:
A. 31 days.
B. 21 days.
C. 46 days.
Answer: A
NOC = DOH + DSO − No. of days of payables
15 = 365 / 14 + 365 / 18 – x
x = 31.35

64. The average market price of a company’s stock over the year was $40 and the price at the end of
the year was $50. The company’s capital structure included:
• Warrants on 10,000 ordinary shares with an exercise price of $35.
• Options on 20,000 ordinary shares with an exercise price of $30.
The number of inferred shares that will be used in the computation of diluted EPS is closest to:
A. 6,250.
B. 19,000.
C. 11,000.
Answer: A
The warrants and options are dilutive, as their exercise prices are lower than the average market
price of the company’s stock over the year.
Proceeds to company from exercise of warrants = $35 × 10,000 = $350,000
Number of shares repurchased at average market price = $350,000 / 40 = 8,750
Net increase in number of shares outstanding = 10,000 − 8,750 = 1,250
Proceeds to company from exercise of options = $30 × 20,000 = $600,000
Number of shares repurchased at average market price = $600,000 / 40 = 15,000
Net increase in number of shares outstanding = 20,000 − 15,000 = 5,000
1,250 + 5,000 = 6,250

company uses the straight-line method instead of the double declining balance method for
depreciation?
A. Operating profit margin
B. Operating return on assets
C. Asset turnover
Answer: C
If a company uses straight line depreciation, it will report:
• Lower asset turnover (due to higher net assets).
• Higher operating profit margin (due to lower depreciation expense).
• Higher operating ROA (due to lower depreciation expense).

A. Business risk.
B. Financial risk.
C. Default risk.
Answer: C
Default risk is a consideration when investing in a bond. It has nothing to do with the risk
associated with investing in a particular project.
74. ABC Company currently has a debt‐to‐equity ratio of 0.3. Its target debt‐to‐equity ratio is 0.4.
The risk‐free rate is 6%, and expected equity market return is 12%. ABC is considering a project
that has a beta of 1.2. Given that the company’s after‐tax cost of debt is 7%, and the applicable
tax rate is 40%, the WACC that should be used in evaluating this project is closest to:
A. 10.63%.
B. 11.43%.
C. 11.77%.
Answer: B
Cost of equity = 0.06 + 1.2 (0.12 − 0.06) = 13.2%
Using component weights in the target capital structure:
WACC = [0.132 × (1 / 1.4)] + [0.07 × (0.4 / 1.4)] = 11.43%

77. Aztec Ltd. is considering investing $650 million in a new project. The CFO of the company tells
the directors that the present value of the net cash flows that will be generated from the project
will be around $800 million. The company has 7 million shares outstanding with a market
price of $120 each. The price of the company’s shares if it undertakes the new project will be
closest to:
A. $114.29.
B. $135.72.
C. $141.43.
© Wiley 2017 All Rights Reserved. Any unauthorized copying or distribution will constitute an infringement of copyright.105
Answer: C
Net present value of the project = 800 – 650 = $150 million
Current market value of the company = 7 × 120 = $840 million
Market value of the company if it undertakes the project = 840 + 150 = $990 million
New share price = 990 / 7 = $141.43

82. An analyst gathered the following information regarding an equity market index. The index was
created on January 1, 2009 at which time its value was set to 1,000. It consists of the following
3 securities:
Securities
Price at
December 31
2009 ($)
Price at
December 31
2010 ($)
Dividends paid
per share ($)
Weight in the
index (%)
A. 35 31 3 25
B. 48 45 2 35
C. 27 32 2 40
Given that dividends are paid at the end of the year and that the price return on the index for 2009
was 8.25%, the value of the price return index at the end of 2010 is closest to:
A. 1,083.
B. 1,108.
C. 1,179.
Answer: B
Price return on security A = (31 − 35) / 35 = –11.43%
Price return on security B = (45 − 48) / 48 = –6.25%
Price return on security C = (32 − 27) / 27 = 18.52%
Price return on the index for 2010:
= (–0.1143 × 0.25) + (–0.0625 × 0.35) + (0.1852 × 0.4) = 2.36%
Therefore, value of the price return index at the end of 2010:
= 1,000 × 1.0825 × 1.0236 = 1,108.047
83. A well‐functioning securities market is least likely to:

84. A limit sell order placed above the best offer is most likely:
A. Referred to as a marketable sell limit order.
B. Referred to as behind the market.
C. Said to have created a new market.
Answer: B
A limit sell order placed above the best offer is referred to as behind the market and will not be
executed unless the market price increases.
A limit order placed below the best bid would be a marketable sell limit order.
A limit sell order placed above the best bid but below the best offer would have created a new
market.
85. Given that an equal‐weighted index and a market‐capitalization‐weighted index consist of the
same securities, underperformance by small‐cap stocks will most likely result in the market‐
capitalization‐weighted index exhibiting:
A. A greater price return than the equal‐weighted index.
B. The same price return as the equal‐weighted index.
C. A lower price return than the equal‐weighted index.
Answer: A
In an equal‐weighted index, large‐cap stocks are underrepresented and small‐cap stocks
are overrepresented compared to a market‐capitalization‐weighted index. Therefore,
underperformance by small‐cap stocks will not affect a market‐capitalization‐weighted index as
much as it would an equal‐weighted index, and lead to the market‐capitalization‐weighted index
having a greater price return than the equal‐weighted index.
86. Consider the following statements:
Statement 1: Apart from normal dividends, cumulative preference shares are entitled to
additional dividends if the company’s profits exceed a pre‐specified level.
Statement 2: From the investor’s perspective, callable common shares are more risky than
putable common shares.
© Wiley 2017 All Rights Reserved. Any unauthorized copying or distribution will constitute an infringement of copyright.109
Which of the following is most likely?
A. Only Statement 1 is incorrect.
B. Only Statement 2 is incorrect.
C. Both statements are correct.
Answer: A
Participating preference shares are entitled to additional dividends if the company’s profits
exceed a pre‐specified level.
Callable common shares limit the investor’s upside potential, while putable common shares
protect the investor on the downside.
87. ABC Company’s dividend growth rate is expected to be 20% for the next three years. After three
years, the company’s dividend growth rate will stabilize at 7%. ABC’s last dividend payment was
$4 per share. Given that its cost of equity is 12%, the current value of ABC’s stock is closest to:
A. $119.08.
B. $107.80.
C. $147.92.
Answer: A
D1 = 4 (1.2) = $4.8
D2 = 4.8 (1.2) = $5.76
D3 = 5.76 (1.2) = $6.91
D4 = 6.91 (1.07) = $7.4
Terminal stock price at the end of Year 3 = 7.4 / (0.12 − 0.07) = $147.92
Current stock price = 4.8 / 1.12 + 5.76 / (1.12)2 + 6.91 / (1.12) 3 + 147.92 / (1.12) 3 = $119.08
88. Companies in industries with low barriers to entry and a large number of customers most likely

C. High High
© Wiley 2017 All Rights Reserved. Any unauthorized copying or distribution will constitute an infringement of copyright.110
Answer: B
Industries with low barriers to entry carry a less significant threat of entry of new competitors.
Customers in industries with a large number of customers typically have low bargaining power.
89. Emanuel purchases 130 shares of Hilton Pharmaceuticals on margin for $45 per share. She sells
her shares after one year for $52 per share. The following information is also available:
Dividend received on the stock = $0.5 per share
Commission paid = $0.15 per share
Leverage ratio = 2.5
Call money rate = 6.5%
Government bill rate = 6%
The total return on Emanuel’s investment is closest to:
A. 30.00%.
B. 15.56%.
C. 24.62%.
Answer: A
Total purchase price = 130 × 45 = $5,850
Proportion of equity investment = 1 / 2.5 = 40%
Equity investment = 1 / 2.5 × 5,850 = $2,340
Therefore, amount borrowed = 5,850 − 2,340 = $3,510
Commission paid on purchase transaction = 130 × 0.15 = $19.5
Total investment = 2,340 + 19.5 = $2,359.5

Questions 91–104 relate to Fixed Income
91. Consider the following statements:
Statement 1: Generally speaking, floating‐rate notes have less interest rate risk than fixed‐rate
bonds.
Statement 2: The spread on a floating‐rate note varies with the issuer’s creditworthiness during
the term of the bond.
Which of the following is most likely?
A. Both statements are incorrect.
B. Only Statement 1 is correct.
C. Only Statement 2 is correct.
Answer: B
FRN’s have lower interest rate risk than fixed‐rate bonds because the coupon rate on a FRN is
reset periodically and brought in line with market interest rates.
The spread on a floating‐rate note is determined at issuance based on the issuer’s creditworthiness
at issuance.
92. Consider the following statements:
Statement 1: The option embedded in a putable bond is more likely to be exercised by the issuer
when interest rates rise.
Statement 2: If a bond is sold between coupon payment dates, accrued interest is due to the
buyer.
Which of the following is most likely?
A. Both statements are incorrect.
B. Only Statement 1 is correct.
C. Only Statement 2 is correct.
Answer: A
The embedded option in a putable bond is likely to be exercised by the investor when interest
rates rise.
If a bond is traded between coupon payment dates, accrued interest is due to the seller.

93. Consider the following statements:
Statement 1: The drawback of credit‐linked bonds is that they can contribute to further
downgrades or eventual default of the issuer.
Statement 2: TIPS offer investors a fixed real return that is protected from inflation risk.
Which of the following is most likely?
A. Only Statement 1 is correct.
B. Only Statement 2 is correct.
C. Both statements are correct.
Answer: C
Becausea rating downgrade results in higher interest payments on credit‐linked bonds, they can
contribute to further downgrades or even an eventual default of the issuer.
Treasury Inflation Protection Securities are inflation‐linked bonds. They are long-term assets with
a fixed real return that is protected from inflation risk.
94. A 7% U.S. corporate bond is priced for settlement on May 18, 2015. The bond makes semiannual
coupon payments on January 20 and July 20 of each year and matures on July 20, 2019. The
bond uses the 30/360 day‐count convention for accrued interest. Given that stated annual yield‐
to‐maturity is 6.5%, the flat price of the bond per 100 of par value on May 18, 2015 is closest to:
A. $101.7892.
B. $103.7054.
C. $104.0386.
Answer: A
Given the 30/360 day‐count convention, there are 118 days between the last coupon on
January 20, 2015, and the settlement date on May 28, 2015 (10 days between January 20 and
January 30, plus 90 days for the full months of February, March, and April, plus 18 days in May).
Therefore, the fraction of the coupon period that has gone by equals 118/180.
As of the last coupon payment date, there are 4.5 years (and nine semiannual periods) remaining
until maturity.

Using stated annual yield‐to‐maturity of 6.5%, or 3.25% per semiannual period, the price of the
bond as of the last coupon payment date is calculated as:
N = 9; PMT = –$3.50; FV = –$100; I/Y = 3.25%; CPT PV; PV = 101.924
The full price on May 18 is calculated as:
PVFull = 101.924 × (1.0325)118/180 = $104.0836
The accrued interest is calculated as:
AI = 118 / 180 × 3.50 = $2.2944
The flat price is calculated as:
PV Flat = 104.0836 − 2.2944 = $101.7892
95. Consider the following statements:
Statement 1: The coupon rate and principal amount on a capital‐indexed bond increases with a
specified index.
Statement 2: In a Bermuda‐style call, the issuer has the right to call bonds on specified dates
following the call protection period.
Which of the following is most likely?
A. Only Statement 1 is correct.
B. Only Statement 2 is correct.
C. Both statements are correct.
Answer: B
In a capital‐indexed bond, a fixed coupon rate is applied to a principal amount that increases with
a specified index, such that the coupon payment also rises with the index. Statement 2 is indeed
correct.

96. Consider the following statements:
Statement 1: Given the term to maturity, a corporate bond cannot possibly offer a lower yield
than a U.S. Treasury.
Statement 2: U.S. Treasures are free of credit risk, but not risk‐free.
Which of the following is most likely?
A. Both statements are correct.
B. Only Statement 1 is correct.
C. Only Statement 2 is correct.
Answer: C
• Given the term to maturity, a putable corporate bond may actually offer a lower yield
than a U.S. Treasury.
• Statement 2 is correct, as U.S. Treasures have an element of reinvestment risk among
other risks.
97. Each of the option‐free bonds listed below has a face value of $1,000:
Bond 1 Bond 2
Time to maturity 10 years 10 years
Annual coupon rate 5.5% 8.5%
Yield to maturity today 6% 6%
If the yield to maturity for both the bonds remains constant over their remaining terms, over time
there will most likely be an increase in the price of:
A. Bond 1 only.
B. Bond 2 only.
C. Both of the bonds.
Answer: A
• Bond 1 will be trading at a discount because its coupon rate is lower than the discount
rate.
• Bond 2 will be trading at a premium because its coupon rate is greater than the discount
rate.
• If yields remain constant until maturity, only Bond 1’s price will increase as it converges
to its par value.

98. Consider the following information regarding a convertible bond:
Par value = $1,000
Conversion ratio = 30:1
Convertible bond price = $1,020
Given that the conversion premium is $30, the current share price is closest to:
A. $30.00.
B. $32.33.
C. $33.00.
Answer: C
Given the convertible bond price of $1,020, a conversion premium of $30 implies that the
conversion value is $990. Because the conversion ratio is 30:1, the current price per share will be
$990/30 = $33.
99. A coupon-bearing bond was purchased at par. If the bond were held until maturity and interest
rates fell during the period, the actual ex‐post return would most likely be:
A. Lower than the YTM at time of purchase.
B. Higher than the YTM at time of purchase.
C. Equal to the YTM at time of purchase because the bond was held until maturity.
Answer: A
The fall in interest rates during the term of the bond leads to a lower yield on reinvestment of
income than the YTM calculated upon purchase. Therefore, the actual return on the bond would
be lower than the YTM.
100. The following information relates to two callable bonds of the same issuer that are currently
callable.
Estimated Percentage Change in Price if Interest Rates Change by:
–100 bps +100 bps
Bond A +4 –6
Bond B +11 –8

Both the bonds have the same maturity and the yield curve for the issuer is flat. Which of the
bonds is most likely the higher coupon bond?
A. Bond A
B. Bond B
C. Both bonds offer the same coupon rate.
Answer: A
• At current yields, Bond A exhibits negative duration, as the percentage price decrease
from an increase in interest rates (–6%) is greater than the percentage price increase from
a decrease in interest rates (4%). Given the current level of interest rates, Bond A must be
the higher coupon bond as it is undergoing “price compression.” Bond A is likely to be
called, as its coupon rate is greater than market yields.
• Bond B exhibits positive convexity. It is not in danger of being called so its coupon rate
must be lower than current market interest rates.
101. A bond is initially trading at a price of $98.725. If interest rates decrease by 25bp, its price is
expected to rise to $99.875. On the other hand, if interest rates increase by 25bp, its price is
expected to fall to $97.465. The bond’s modified duration is closest to:
A. 2.36.
B. 4.88.
C. 5.12.
Answer: A
Modified duration = (99.875 – 97.465)/(2 × 98.725 × 0.0025) = 4.88
102. Which of the following embedded options is most likely to favor an issuer of securities?
A. A conversion option
B. A doubling option
C. A floor on a floating‐rate security
Answer: B

112. Jupiter Fund of Funds invests $250 million in each of two funds, Venus Hedge Fund and Mars
Hedge Fund. Jupiter has a “2 and 10” fee structure. Both hedge funds charge a 2% management
fee based on assets under management at the end of the year and a 20% incentive fee, which
is calculated net of management fee. After one year, Jupiter’s investments in Venus and Mars
are valued at $230 million and $320 million respectively, after accounting for their respective
management and incentive fees. The annual return to an investor in Jupiter, net of fees, at the
fund of funds level is closest to:
A. 6.80%.
B. 20.00%.
C. 2.63%.
Answer: A
End of year capital = $230m + $320m = $550 million
Management fee = $550m × 2% = $11 million
Incentive fee = ($550m − $500m) × 10% = $5 million
Total fees = $11m + $5m = $16 million
Investor’s net return = ($550m − $500m − $16m) / $500m = 6.8%
113. Consider the following statements:

Questions 115–120 relate to Portfolio Management
115. Consider the following statements:
Statement 1: A portfolio on the minimum variance frontier may have a positive or negative
weight on the risk‐free asset.
Statement 2: An investor with a negative risk-aversion coefficient would have an indifference
curve with a negative slope.
Which of the following is most likely?
A. Both statements are correct.
B. Only one statement is correct.
C. Both statements are incorrect.
Answer: B
Any portfolio on the minimum variance frontier only contains risky assets. The weight of the
risk‐free asset is zero.
A risk‐averse investor has a negative risk aversion coefficient. Because utility increases with risk
and return, the indifference curve for a risk‐averse investor has a negative slope.
116. The correlation between two assets equals –0.296 and the covariance between the two assets is
–0.0104. Which of the following least likely lists the standard deviations of the two assets?
A. 45.45% and 7.73%
B. 23.4% and 14.1%
C. 35.54% and 9.886%
Answer: B
The product of the two asset’s standard deviations, x, is calculated as:
Correlation = Covariance / x
x = –0.0104 / –0.296 = 0.0351
The product of 23.4% and 14.1% does not equal 0.0351.

117. Beta can be defined as:
A. The covariance of an asset with the market as a proportion of the market’s standard deviation.
B. The covariance of an asset with the market as a proportion of the market’s covariance with
itself.
C. The correlation of an asset with the variance of the market.
Answer: B
Beta equals the covariance of an asset with the market as a proportion of the market’s covariance
with itself. The market’s covariance with itself basically equals the market’s variance.
118. Portfolio A has a higher total risk but lower total return than the market portfolio. Which of the
following is least likely?
A. Portfolio A has a beta that is lower than 1.
B. Portfolio A has relatively high unsystematic risk.
C. Portfolio A cannot possibly lie on the SML.
Answer: C
The portfolio can lie on the SML if most of its total risk is unsystematic risk that can be
diversified away. To plot on the SML, the portfolio must have a beta of less than 1, as its expected
return is lower than that of the market portfolio.
119. Consider the following statements:

17. A team of analysts of Brookfront Inc. issues an under perform rating for an emerging clothing
company, Fashion Fabrics. Justine, a member of the team, does not support the recommendation.
Based on her own research, she believes that the company is a good long-term investment.
In order to comply with Standard V (A): Diligence and Reasonable Basis, Justine should most
likely:
A. Dissociate with the group immediately.
B. Let her name be included in the report with a documentation of her difference of opinion.
C. Let her name be included in the report and change her personal recommendation on the
company.
Answer: B
According to Standard V (A), members may be part of a group or team that is collectively
responsible for producing investment analysis or research. The conclusions or recommendations
of the report represent the consensus of the group and are not necessarily the views of the
member, even though the name of the member is included on the report. In such a case, if the
member is confident in the process, she does not have to dissociate from the report if it does not
reflect her opinion. She should, however, document her difference of opinion with the team.

Questions 19–32 relate to Quantitative Methods
19. Given that the observations in a data set do not have the same value, the relationship among the
arithmetic mean, harmonic mean, and geometric mean of the data set is most likely:
A. Harmonic mean < geometric mean < arithmetic mean.
B. Geometric mean < harmonic mean < arithmetic mean.
C. Harmonic mean < arithmetic mean < geometric mean.
Answer: A
When observations in the data set do not all have the same value, the harmonic mean is lower
than the geometric mean, which itself is lower than the arithmetic mean.
20. A distribution is characterized by large infrequent losses and small frequent gains. Which of the
following is most likely?
A. The distribution is negatively skewed, and its mean is lower than its median.
B. The distribution is positively skewed, and its median is lower than its mode.
C. The distribution is negatively skewed, and its median is greater than its mode.
Answer: A
The tail of the distribution is elongated on the lower or the left side, so it is a negatively skewed
distribution. For such distributions, the mean is lower than the median, which itself is less than
the mode.
21. An analyst states that the probability that the economy will continue to expand in the coming year
is 25%. Further, she anticipates that the probability of the Fed increasing interest rates is 50%.
The joint probability that the economy will continue to expand and the Fed will increase interest
rates is 35%. Given this information, the probability that the Fed will increase interest rates or
that the economy will continue to expand is closest to:
A. 60%.
B. 75%.
C. 40%.
Answer: C
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) – P(AB)
P(Fed will raise interest rates OR economy will expand) = 0.50 + 0.25 − 0.35 = 0.40

22. Consider the following statements:
Statement 1: The continuously compounded stated annual rate is always lower than the effective
annual rate.
Statement 2: A stock with a holding period return of 25% over two years offers a continuously
compounded return of 11.16%.
Which of the following is most likely?
A. Both statements are correct.
B. Only Statement 1 is correct.
C. Only Statement 2 is correct.
Answer: A
• The continuously compounded stated annual rate (rcc) is always lower than the effective
annual rate (EAR). rcc = ln (EAR + 1)
• 0.25 = ercc × 2 − 1
rcc = [ln (0.25 + 1)] / 2 = 11.16%
23. Which of the following is least likely a desirable characteristic of an estimator?
A. Unbiasedness
B. Efficiency
C. Continuity

25. For a two‐tailed hypothesis test, the p‐value is given as 0.04. At the 5% level of significance, the
null hypothesis will most likely be:
A. Rejected.
B. Not rejected.
C. Accepted.
Answer: A
• The p‐value is the lowest level of significance at which the null hypothesis can be
rejected. At the 5% significance level the null hypothesis will be rejected, as the
significance level of the test is greater than the p‐value (4%).
• We can only reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis in a hypothesis test. The null is
never “accepted.”
26. An analyst can most likely compute the correlation between two random variables by:
A. Dividing the covariance between the two variables by the product of their variances.
B. Multiplying the covariance between the two variables by the product of their standard
deviations.
C. Dividing the covariance between the two variables by the product of their standard
deviations.
Answer: C
Correlation (X,Y) = Covariance (X,Y) / (Std. dev A × Std. dev B)
27. An analyst gathered the following information for a stock:
Year Return

3 –3.2%
4 4.5%
The mean absolute deviation of the stock’s returns is closest to:
A. 3.53%.
B. 0%.
C. 3.85%.
Answer: A
Mean return = (8.5 + 5.6 − 3.2 + 4.5) / 4 = 3.85%

28. An investor purchases a T‐bill for $940 when its money market yield is 6.2% and there are
120 days left to maturity. The HPY and EAY for the T‐bill are closest to:
HPY EAY
A. 2.07% 6.42%
B. 2.7% 6.42%
C. 2.07% 6.7%
Answer: A
HPY = 6.2 × 120 / 360 = 2.07%
EAY = (1 + 0.0207) 365/120 − 1 = 6.42%
29. The probability that it will rain on any given day in the month of June (30 days) is 0.3. The
expected value and standard deviation of the number of rainy days in June are closest to:
Expected Value Standard Deviation
A. 9 6.3
B. 9 2.51
C. 21 6.3

31. The tax authorities of Probalina will soon be making an announcement regarding the corporate
tax rate for the next year. The corporate tax rate currently stands at 10%. There is a 0.4 chance
that the tax rate will remain unchanged, a 0.15 probability that it will be raised to 20%, and a
0.45 chance that Probalina will be made a tax‐free zone. The development projects in Probalina
require a large investment. The probability of the country’s investment requirements being met
are as follows:
• If the tax rate is 0%, the probability of investment requirements being met = 0.9.
• If the tax rate is 10%, the probability of investment requirements being met = 0.5.
• If the tax rate is 20%, probability of investment requirements being met = 0.2.
The probability of there not being enough funds to meet Probalina’s investment requirements
given that the tax rate remains unchanged is closest to:
A. 0.2.
B. 0.5.
C. 0.9.
Answer: B
If tax rates remain unchanged at 10%, there is a 0.5 chance that the investment requirements will
be met. Therefore, the probability of their not being met equals 1– 0.5 = 0.5 or 50%.
32. If the probability of success in a binomial experiment is 0.75, the binomial distribution would
most likely be:
A. Symmetric.
B. Right‐skewed.
C. Left‐skewed.
Answer: C
If the probability of success in a binomial experiment is greater than 0.5, the binomial distribution
would be left‐skewed (i.e., have a long tail on the left).

Questions 33–44 relate to Economics
33. Consider the following statements:
Statement 1: All inferior goods are Giffen goods, but not all Giffen goods are inferior goods.
Statement 2: Veblen goods and Giffen goods both have upward‐sloping demand curves.
Which of the following is most likely?
A. Both statements are correct.
B. Only one statement is correct.
C. Both statements are incorrect.
Answer: B
Statement 1 is incorrect. All Giffen goods are inferior goods (as the income effect of a price
reduction is negative), but not all inferior goods are Giffen goods (as the income effect for
inferior goods does not necessarily outweigh the substitution effect).
Statement 2 is correct. Both Veblen goods and Giffen goods exhibit a positive relationship
between own‐price and quantity demanded.
34. Schumpeter’s “creative destruction” process most likely asserts that:
A. Perfectly competitive markets mainly exist in the long run.
B. Monopolies can earn economic profits in the long run.
C. The demand curve facing an oligopoly will kink at the current market price.
Answer: A
Joseph Schumpeter suggested that perfect competition is more of a long‐run type of market
structure. In the short run, companies may develop new products or processes that give them an
edge over competitors, but in the long run, other firms follow the innovative company and try to
copy its idea.

35. In which of the following types of price discrimination does the monopolist use the quantity
purchased by a consumer to determine how much she values the product?
A. First-degree price discrimination
B. Second-degree price discrimination
C. Third-degree price discrimination
Answer: B
• In first degree price discrimination, the monopolist charges each consumer the highest
price she is willing and able to pay.
• In second‐degree price discrimination, the monopolist offers a variety of quantity‐based
pricing options that induce customers to self‐select based on how highly they value the
product (e.g., volume discounts, product bundling).
• Third‐degree price discrimination can occur when customers can be separated by
geographical or other traits. One set of customers is charged a higher price while the
other is charged a lower price (e.g., airlines charge higher fares on one-day, round‐trip
tickets, as they are more likely to be purchased by businesspeople).
36. A firm in perfect competition will continue to operate in the short run as long as:
A. Price exceeds average total cost.
B. Price exceeds average variable cost.
C. Price exceeds average fixed cost.
Answer: B
In the short run, a firm in perfect competition will continue to produce as long as price exceeds
AVC, as this would mean that it is covering at least a portion of its fixed costs.
37. Which of the following most likely represents the effects of an increase in the price level?
IS Curve LM Curve AD Curve
A. Unchanged Shifts to the left Unchanged
B. Shifts to the left Unchanged Shifts to the left
C. Unchanged Shifts to the left Shifts to the right
Answer: A
• A change in prices has no impact on the IS curve.
• An increase in the price level decreases real money supply, so income has to fall so that
real money demand also falls and keeps the money market in equilibrium. Therefore, the
LM curve shifts to the left.
• There is a movement along the AD curve (no shift).

38. Which of the following most likely represents the causes of an increase in aggregate demand?
Taxes Bank Reserves Indirect Exchange Rate
A. Decrease Increase Decrease
B. Decrease Decrease Increase
C. Increase Increase Decrease
Answer: A
• A decrease in taxes increases disposable income and consumption.
• An increase in bank reserves increases money supply, reduces interest rates, and
increases consumption and investment.
• A decrease (depreciation) in the indirect exchange rate (FC/DC) results in higher exports
and lower imports.
39. A situation in which injections of money into the economy fail to reduce interest rates or
influence real economy activity is known as:
A. Money neutrality.
B. Liquidity trap.
C. Quantitative easing.
Answer: B
• Money neutrality states that money supply and/or the money growth rate will not affect
the real interest rate, but will influence inflationary expectations.
• Quantitative easing is basically an expansionary open market operation conducted on a
much larger scale in the hope of stimulating the economy.
• A liquidity trap is a situation where an interest rate cut (to counter deflation in the
economy) fails to lower savings and stimulate consumption.
40. Unemployment benefits are examples of:
A. Automatic stabilizers.
B. Discretionary fiscal actions.
C. Quantitative easing.
Answer: A
Unemployment benefits are examples of needs‐tested spending, which is an automatic stabilizer
embedded in fiscal policy.

41. Which of the following models of international trade asserts that differences in factor
endowments are the primary source of comparative advantage?
A. Ricardian model
B. Heckscher‐Ohlin model
C. Fischer model
Answer: B
• The Ricardian model asserts that differences in technology are the key source of
comparative advantage.
• The Heckscher‐Ohlin model asserts that differences in factor endowments are the
primary source of comparative advantage.
• The Fisher effect is directly related to the concept of money neutrality. It states that the
real rate of interest in an economy is stable over time so that changes in nominal interest
rates are the result of changes in expected inflation.
42. Which of the following combinations of changes in the nominal exchange rate, foreign inflation,
and domestic inflation will result in a decrease in the real exchange rate (in terms of DC/FC)?
Nominal Exchange Rate Foreign Inflation Domestic Inflation
A. Decrease Decrease Increase
B. Increase Increase Decrease
C. Decrease Increase Decrease
Answer: A
The real exchange rate is positively related to the nominal exchange rate and foreign inflation, but
negatively related to domestic inflation.
43. A trader is quoted the following exchange rates:
Spot Rate Expected Spot Rate in One Year
USD:JPY 77.68 77.50
GBP:USD 1.5682 1.5548
EUR:USD 1.3754 1.3644
Which of the following correctly lists the currencies from strongest to weakest based on their
performance over the next year?
A. JPY, USD, GBP, EUR
B. USD, JPY, EUR, GBP
C. JPY, USD, EUR, GBP
© Wiley 2017 All Rights Reserved. Any unauthorized copying or distribution will constitute an infringement of copyright.142
Answer: C
Based on the information given, the EUR:USD exchange rate is expected to decline from 1.3754
to 1.3644. This means that EUR is expected to depreciate versus USD.
Further, the GBP:USD exchange rate is expected to decline from 1.5682 to 1.5548. This means
that GBP is also expected to depreciate versus USD.
Therefore, we can say that USD is expected to strengthen against both EUR and GBP.
In order to determine which currency is stronger between EUR and GBP, we will need to
calculate the spot EUR:GBP cross‐rate as well as the expected EUR‐GBP cross‐rate in one year.
Current EUR‐GBP spot rate = 1.3754 × (1.5682) –1 = 0.8771
Expected EUR‐GBP spot rate in one year = 1.3644 × (1.5548)–1 = 0.8775
The EUR:GBP exchange rate is expected to increase from 0.8771 to 0.8775. This means that
EUR is expected to appreciate against GBP.
The USD:JPY exchange rate is expected to decline from 77.68 to 77.50, which means that USD
is expected to depreciate against JPY.
Therefore, the list of currencies from strongest to weakest based on their performance over the
next year is:
JPY, USD, EUR, GBP
44. The quality bias that arises when a Laspeyres index is used to calculate inflation can most likely
be mitigated by:
A. Using hedonic pricing.
B. Introducing new products in the basket more regularly.
C. Using a Fischer index.
Answer: A
• Hedonic pricing refers to the practice of adjusting prices for quality improvements.
• The substitution bias can be mitigated by using chained price index formulas like the
Fischer index.
• Introducing new products into the basket more regularly deals with the new product bias.

Questions 45–68 relate to Financial Reporting and Analysis
Assume IFRS unless otherwise stated.
45. Ratios are an output of which step of the financial statement analysis framework?
A. Process data
B. Collect input data
C. Analyze/interpret the processed data
Answer: A
Ratios are an output of the “process data” step and an input for the “analyze/interpret the
processed data” step in the financial statement analysis framework.
46. Which of the following most likely contributes toward faithful representation of financial
statements?
A. Neutrality
B. Materiality
C. Understandability
Answer: A
Faithful representation requires that information should be complete, neutral, and free from error.
Materiality is an aspect of relevance.
Understandability is one of the four supplementary qualitative characteristics of financial
statements.
47. During 2009, Quintus Inc. sold a piece of land to Solonius Inc. for $10,000,000. Quintus received
$4,000,000 during 2009, and will receive the remaining amount the following year. It purchased
this piece of land for $3,000,000 in 1999. The profit that Quintus will report in 2009 is closest to:
Installment Method Cost Recovery Method
A. $2,800,000 None
B. $2,800,000 $1,000,000
C. $1,000,000 None
© Wiley 2017 All Rights Reserved. Any unauthorized copying or distribution will constitute an infringement of copyright.144
Answer: B
Under the installment method, the percentage of profit recognized in a given period equals the
percentage of total cash received during the period.
Profit recognized during 2009 = 4m / 10m × (10m − 3m) = $2.8m
Under the cost recovery method, profits are only recognized once total cash received exceeds
total cost.
Profit recognized during 2009 = 4m − 3m = $1m
48. Which of the following costs are least likely to be capitalized inventory costs?
A. Costs of purchase.
B. Selling and marketing costs.
C. Costs of conversion.
Answer: B
All administrative overheads and selling costs cannot be included in the carrying value of
inventory; they must be expensed as incurred.
49. Assume U.S. GAAP applies. A company’s gross fixed assets increased from the previous year
to this year, while the amount of accumulated depreciation shown on its balance sheet decreased
from the previous year to the current year. Which of the following is most likely?
A. There has been a purchase and sale of long‐lived assets over the year.
B. There has only been a purchase of long‐lived assets over the year.
C. There has only been an impairment of long‐lived assets over the year.
Answer: A
The increase in gross fixed assets (historical cost) over the year indicates that the company has
purchased long‐lived assets during the year. Note that U.S. GAAP does not allow revaluation of
fixed assets.
Despite the asset acquisition, if accumulated depreciation has fallen over the year, the company
has sold a long‐lived asset as well.
50. An increase in which of the following will not always result in an improvement in a company’s
return on equity?
A. Financial leverage ratio
B. Tax burden ratio
C. Net profit margin.
© Wiley 2017 All Rights Reserved. Any unauthorized copying or distribution will constitute an infringement of copyright.145
Answer: A
An increase in the financial leverage will not always lead to a higher ROE. As a company takes
on more debt, its interest costs rise and the interest burden ratio falls (so does the net profit
margin).
51. The net realizable value of a unit of a company’s inventory is lower than its replacement cost.
The replacement cost of inventory equals its original cost. Which of the following is most likely
regarding the value of inventory recognized under IFRS and U.S. GAAP?
A. Inventory value will be the same under both.
B. Inventory value will be higher under U.S. GAAP.
C. Inventory value will be lower under U.S. GAAP.
Answer: A
• Under IFRS, inventory is valued at the lower or cost and NRV. Because NRV is lower
than original cost, the company will record its inventory at NRV.
• Under U.S. GAAP, original cost is compared to replacement cost where replacement
cost must lie between NRV minus the normal profit margin and the NRV. Because
replacement cost is greater than NRV, adjusted replacement cost (market) equals NRV,
and the company will record its inventory at NRV.
52. Assume U.S. GAAP applies. In a period of rising prices and stable inventory quantities, use of
LIFO will most likely result in:
A. Lower solvency ratios.
B. Lower interest coverage ratios.
C. Lower inventory turnover ratios.
Answer: B
In a period of rising prices and stable inventory quantities, use of LIFO will result in higher
solvency ratios, a higher inventory turnover ratio, and a lower interest coverage ratio (EBIT is
lower under LIFO due to higher COGS).
53. Which of the following most accurately lists the requirements regarding accounting for financing
liabilities under U.S. GAAP and IFRS?
A. The effective interest method is required under U.S. GAAP. The effective interest or the
straight-line method may be used under IFRS.
B. The effective interest method is required under IFRS. The effective interest or the straight-
line method may be used under U.S. GAAP.
C. The effective interest method is required under IFRS. The straight-line method is required
under IFRS.
© Wiley 2017 All Rights Reserved. Any unauthorized copying or distribution will constitute an infringement of copyright.146
Answer: B
The effective interest method is required under IFRS and preferred under U.S. GAAP. The
straight-line method is also permitted under U.S. GAAP.
54. Consider the following statements:
Statement 1: When the tax base of a liability exceeds its carrying value, it results in a deferred
tax asset.
Statement 2: Permanent differences result in a difference between the company’s statutory and
effective tax rate.
Which of the following is most likely?
A. Both statements are correct.
B. Only Statement 1 is correct.
C. Only Statement 2 is correct.
Answer: C
• When the tax base of a liability exceeds its carrying value, it results in a deferred tax
liability.
• Statement 2 is correct.
55. Which of the following is most likely when a temporary difference gives rise to a deferred tax
liability?
A. Higher expenses are recognized on the financial statements than on the tax return.
B. A liability’s tax base is lower than its carrying value.
C. Taxable income is lower than accounting profit.
Answer: C
A temporary difference gives rise to a deferred tax liability when:
• Lower expenses are recognized on the financial statements than on the tax return.
• A liability’s tax base is greater than its carrying value.
• Taxable income is lower than accounting profit.

56. Assume U.S. GAAP applies. Compared to a scenario in which it issued bonds at par, a company
that issued bonds at a discount will least likely:
A. Report higher interest expense each year during the bond’s term.
B. Report an increasing book value of the liability each year.
C. Report lower cash flow from operations.
Answer: C
Compared to a scenario in which it issues bonds at par, a company that issues bonds at a discount
will record:
• Lower financing cash inflows at issuance.
• Higher interest expense every year during the term of the bonds.
• Identical financing cash outflows at maturity (par value).
• Identical operating cash outflows each year (coupon payment).
57. Recognition of a lease as a finance lease as opposed to an operating lease by the lessee will most
likely result in a higher:
A. Debt‐to‐assets ratio.
B. Return on assets.
C. Current ratio.
Answer: A
• Under a finance lease, the lessee recognizes an asset and an equal‐in‐value liability on
its books at inception of the lease. The percentage increase in debt is greater than the
percentage increase in assets (for any company debt < assets). Therefore, the numerator
effect dominates and the ratio increases upon recognition of a finance lease.
• Because assets increase upon recognition of a finance lease, ROA falls.
• Because current liabilities also increase upon recognition of a finance lease (current
portion of lease obligation), the current ratio falls.
58. In order to inflate current-period earnings, a company would least likely:
A. Increase the useful life of depreciable assets.
B. Increase estimates of uncollectible accounts receivable.
C. Capitalize a cost rather than expense it.
Answer: B
• Increasing the useful life of depreciable assets would lower depreciation expense and
increase net income.
• Increasing the estimated amount for the uncollectible amount would decrease net income.
Capitalizing a cost rather than expensing it would increase net income.

59. Which of the following is most likely regarding the classification of an item as an extraordinary item?
U.S. GAAP IFRS
A. Permitted Not permitted
B. Permitted Permitted
C. Not permitted Permitted
Answer: A
• IFRS does not permit the classification of an expense as an extraordinary item.
• Under U.S. GAAP an item may be classified as an extraordinary item if it is unusual in
nature and infrequent in occurrence.
60. Raven Inc.’s balance sheet shows property, plant, and equipment at a historical cost of $223.87
million and accumulated depreciation of $175.67 million. Depreciation expense in the most
recent year was $25.89 million. The average remaining useful life of ABC’s property, plant, and
equipment is closest to:
A. 6.79 years.
B. 1.86 years.
C. 8.65 years.
Answer: B
Average remaining useful life = (Historical cost − Accumulated depreciation) / Annual
depreciation = (223.87 − 175.67) / 25.89 = 1.86 years
61. What type of audit opinion is least desired when analyzing financial data?
A. A qualified opinion
B. An unqualified opinion
C. An adverse opinion
Answer: C
Average remaining useful life = (Historical cost – Accumulated depreciation)/Annual
depreciation = (223.87 – 175.67)/25.89 = 1.86 years
62. A company sold a piece of equipment for $10,000. The historical cost of this equipment was
$20,000 and accumulated depreciation on the equipment amounted to $8,000. The effect of this
transaction alone is most likely that:
A. CFO will exceed net income by $2,000.
B. Net income will exceed CFO by $2,000.
C. CFI will decrease by $10,000.
© Wiley 2017 All Rights Reserved. Any unauthorized copying or distribution will constitute an infringement of copyright.149
Answer: A
Book value of equipment = $20,000 – $8,000 = $12,000
Gain/(loss) on sale = $10,000 – $12,000 = –$2,000
Because the company makes a loss on the sale, CFO will be greater than net income.
63. An upward revaluation of a long‐lived asset is least likely to result in a decrease in:
A. A company’s debt‐assets ratio.
B. A company’s return on assets in future years.
C. A company’s current ratio.
Answer: C
Upward revaluation of a long‐lived asset has no impact on a company’s current ratio.
64. The objective of financial statements most likely is:
A. To provide historical trends about the company’s performance.
B. To help users in making forecasts about the future performance of the company.
C. To provide information that is useful to a wide range of users in making economic decisions.
Answer: C
The objective of financial statements is to provide information that is useful to a wide variety of

costs are considered in the discount rate (required rate of return).
70. The point of intersection between the marginal cost of capital and the investment opportunity
schedule is known as the:
A. Crossover rate.
B. Optimal capital budget.
C. WACC.
Answer: B
The optimal capital budget occurs at the point where the MCC schedule intersects the investment
opportunity schedule.
71. All other factors remaining the same, which of the following statements is most likely regarding
yields on short-term investments?
A. The money market yield will be greater than the bond equivalent yield.
B. The discount basis yield will be lower than the money market yield.
C. The discount basis yield will be greater than the bond equivalent yield.
Answer: B
• The discount basis yield will be lower than the money market yield, as it is based on the
face value, not the price. Because the face value of a discounted instrument is greater
than its price, the discount basis yield will be lower.
• The bond equivalent yield is greater than the money market yield because it is annualized
over a 365‐day year, whereas the money market yield uses a 360‐day year.
• The discount basis yield can be greater than or less than the bond equivalent yield.

protect their interests.
73. Michael wants to calculate the WACC for a company which has $6 million worth of debt
outstanding with an interest rate of 7%. The company is expected to issue new debt at an interest
rate of 8%. Assuming a tax rate of 40%, the company’s after‐tax cost of debt to be used in
calculating the WACC is closest to:
A. 4.2%.
B. 7%.
C. 4.8%.
Answer: C
After‐tax cost of debt = 0.08 × (1 − 0.4) = 4.8%
74. A manufacturing firm issues a semi‐annual coupon bond to finance a new project. The bond has
a par value of $1,000, offers a coupon rate of 9%, and will mature in 15 years. Given that the
bond’s current market value is $1,020.63, and the applicable tax rate is 35%, the company’s after‐
tax cost of debt is closest to:
A. 4.38%.
B. 8.75%.
C. 5.69%.
© Wiley 2017 All Rights Reserved. Any unauthorized copying or distribution will constitute an infringement of copyright.153
Answer: C
N = 30; PV = –$1,020.63; FV = $1,000; PMT = $45; CPT I/Y; I/Y = 4.375
The yield to maturity on a BEY basis equals 4.375 × 2 = 8.75%. This is the before‐tax cost of debt (rd).
After‐tax cost of debt = rd (1 – t) = 8.75 (1 – 0.35) = 5.688%
75. A 180‐day U.S. T‐bill with a par value of $1,000 is issued at a discount of 8%. The bond
equivalent yield for this security is closest to:
A. 8%.
B. 8.45%.
C. 8.11%.
Answer: B
Purchase price = 1,000 − [0.08 × (180 / 360) × 1,000] = $960
Bond equivalent yield = [(1,000 − 960) / 960] × 365 / 180 = 8.45%
76. An analyst gathers the following information about the cost of raising new debt and equity for a
company:
New Debt ($
millions)
After‐Tax Cost
of Debt (%)
New Equity
($ millions)
Cost of
Equity (%)
≤ 5 5 ≤ 6 12
> 5 6 > 6 13
The company’s target capital structure is 70% equity and 30% debt. If the company raises $12m
in financing, its cost of capital will be closest to:
A. 10.90%.
B. 10.20%.
C. 10.60%.
Answer: C
Break point for debt = 5 / 0.3 = $16.67m
Because the company will only be raising $12m (less than the break point for debt), its after‐tax
cost of debt equals 5%.
Break point for equity = 6 / 0.7 = $8.57m
Because the company will be raising $12m (more than the break point for equity) its cost of
equity equals 13%.
WACC = [0.13 × 0.7] + [0.05 × 0.3] = 10.6%.

77. A company has been offered trade credit terms of “1/30 net 50.” What is the cost of trade credit
for the company if it pays on the 40th day?
A. 9.60%
B. 44.32%
C. 13.00%
Answer: B
Cost of trade credit = {1 + [0.01 / (1 − 0.01)]} 365/10 − 1 = 44.32%
78. Which of the following is least likely an issue in estimating a company’s cost of debt?
A. Some debt instruments may contain option‐like features.
B. Some companies may use leases extensively as a source of finance.
C. Companies in different jurisdictions may face different tax rates.
Answer: C
Different tax rates across companies do not create problems in estimating the cost of debt. Once
the before‐tax cost of debt has been determined, it is adjusted for the company’s tax rate to
determine the after‐tax cost of debt.

86. An analyst gathered the following information about a company:
Next year’s dividend = $3.75
Risk‐free rate of return = 5%
Market risk premium = 8%
Beta of company’s common stock = 1.1
If the analyst estimates that the selling price of the company’s stock after one year will be $43,
the value of the company’s common stock today is closest to:
A. $41.
B. $42.
C. $43.
Answer: A
Use the one‐period DDM.
Cost of equity = 0.05 + 1.1 (0.08) = 13.8%

87. XYZ Company plans not to pay out any dividends for the next four years. After four years, the
company will maintain a dividend payout ratio of 45%. The company’s EPS in Year 4 is expected
to be $4.50, and is expected to grow at 7% forever. Given a cost of equity of 12%, the current
value of the stock is closest to:
A. $25.74.
B. $27.54.
C. $24.59.
Answer: B
EPS in Year 5 = 4.5 × 1.07 = $4.815
Dividend in Year 5 = 4.815 × 0.45 = $2.16675
Price at the end of Year 4 = 2.17 / (0.12 − 0.07) = $43.335
Current value of stock = 43.34 / (1.12)4 = $27.54

Questions 91–104 relate to Fixed Income
91. Which of the following bonds is most likely to exhibit the greatest interest rate risk, assuming that
the yield curve is flat?
Bond A is a 5%, 20-year bond with no embedded options.
Bond B is a 6%, 18-year bond with no embedded options.
Bond C is a 5.5%, 15-year bond with no embedded options.
A. Bond A
B. Bond C
C. Bond B
Answer: A
Bond A will exhibit the greatest interest rate, risk assuming the yield curve is flat, because it has
the lowest coupon rate and the longest term to maturity.
92. Consider the following statements:
Statement 1: Sinking fund arrangements are not likely to reduce credit risk.
Statement 2: Sinking fund arrangements are not likely to reduce reinvestment risk.
Which of the following is most likely?
A. Both statements are correct.
B. Only Statement 1 is correct.
C. Only Statement 2 is correct.
Answer: C
• Sinking fund provisions reduce credit risk, as investors receive interest and principal
repayments during the term of the bonds.
• Sinking funds increase reinvestment risk, as interest and principal repayments may have
to be reinvested at lower rates if interest rates have fallen since the time of purchase.
93. The fact that ELNs are generally principal protected means that investors are most likely
protected from:
A. A decline in the value of the index since issuance.
B. Credit risk of the issuer.
C. A decline in the value of the index since issuance and credit risk of the issuer.
© Wiley 2017 All Rights Reserved. Any unauthorized copying or distribution will constitute an infringement of copyright.161
Answer: A
Equity‐linked notes guarantee investors repayment of 100% of principal even if the value of the
index has fallen since issuance. However, the principal payment is still subject to credit risk of the
issuer. If the issuer defaults, the investor may not receive anything even if the underlying index
has increased in value.
94. Consider the following statements:
Statement 1: The primary driver of yields on CDs is the credit‐worthiness of the issuing bank.
Statement 2: Euro commercial paper is quoted on an add‐on yield basis.
Which of the following is most likely?
A. Only Statement 1 is correct.
B. Only Statement 2 is correct.
C. Both statements are correct.
Answer: C
The credit‐worthiness of the issuing bank has more of an influence on the yield on a certificate of
deposit than the term to maturity.
Euro commercial paper is quoted on an add‐on yield basis, while U.S. commercial paper is a pure
discount instrument.
95. Consider the following statements:
Statement 1: When the dealer is borrowing cash and providing collateral, it is known as a reverse
repo.
Statement 2: The greater the credit risk in the collateral, the higher the repo rate.
Which of the following is most likely?
A. Only Statement 1 is incorrect.
B. Only Statement 2 is incorrect.
C. Both statements are correct.
© Wiley 2017 All Rights Reserved. Any unauthorized copying or distribution will constitute an infringement of copyright.162
Answer: A
Standard practice is to define the transaction based on the perspective of the dealer. If the dealer
is borrowing cash and providing collateral, it is known as a repurchase agreement. If the dealer is
lending cash and accepting collateral, it is known as a reverse repurchase agreement.
Statement 2 is indeed correct. Repo rates increase with the level of credit risk in the collateral.
96. Consider the following statements:
Statement 1: The accrued interest on a bond does not depend on the yield to maturity.
Statement 2: The interest yield on a bond is computed by dividing the annual cash coupon
payment by the full price.
Which of the following is most likely?
A. Only Statement 1 is incorrect.
B. Only Statement 2 is incorrect.
C. Both statements are correct.
Answer: B
The accrued interest on a bond is the same regardless of the yield to maturity. The accrued
interest calculation does not consider the time value of money.
The interest yield (also known as the current yield) on a bond is computed by dividing the annual
cash coupon payment by the flat price.
97. Consider the following information:
Statement 1: Generally speaking, the higher the level of interest rates, the smaller the difference
between the stated annual rates for any two periodicities.
Statement 2: The feature that differentiates spot rates from yields to maturity on coupon bonds is
that spot rates are yields that have no element of reinvestment risk.
Which of the following is most likely?
A. Only Statement 1 is incorrect.
B. Only Statement 2 is incorrect.
C. Both statements are correct.
© Wiley 2017 All Rights Reserved. Any unauthorized copying or distribution will constitute an infringement of copyright.163
Answer: A
Generally speaking, the lower the level of interest rates, the smaller the difference between the
stated annual rates for any two periodicities.
Spot rates have no element of reinvestment risk, as they represent yields on zero-coupon
bonds. Yields to maturity on coupon‐bonds make the assumption that all interim cash flows are
reinvested at the stated YTM until maturity.
98. For putable bonds, the z‐volatility spread will most likely be:
A. Lower than the option‐adjusted spread.
B. Higher than the option‐adjusted spread.
C. Equal to the option‐adjusted spread.
Answer: A
For putable bonds the z‐spread is lower than the option‐adjusted spread. The yield on the putable
bond must be lower than the yield on a bond with no embedded options to compensate the issuer
for the option that it has sold to the investor.
99. An analyst gathers the following information:
3‐year spot rate = 4%
5‐year spot rate = 5%
2‐year forward rate 5 years from today = 3.5%
3‐year forward rate 7 years from today = 4.25%
2‐year forward rate 8 years from today = 6%
Given that all the above spot rates are effective annual rates, the 8‐year spot rate is closest to:
A. Cannot be calculated based on the given information.
B. 4.095%.

100. An analyst calculates that the price of an option‐free bond with a 5% coupon would experience
a 13.5% change if yields were to increase by 100 basis points. If yields were to decrease by
100 basis points instead, the bond’s price would most likely:
A. Increase by 13.5%.
B. Increase by more than 13.5%.
C. Decrease by more than 13.5%.
Answer: B
For an option‐free bond, the percentage price decrease from an increase in interest rates is lower
than the percentage price increase from a decrease in interest rates. Because the bond would fall
by 13.5% if rates increased by 100 bps, it would increase by more than 13.5% if rates fell by
100 bps.
101. Consider a newly issued, seven‐year, 5% annual‐pay bond that is priced at 106 per 100 of par to
yield 4%. The price value of a basis point for this bond is closest to:
A. $0.02.
B. $0.06.
C. $0.12.
Answer: B
PV+ can be calculated as:
N = 7; FV = 100; PMT = 4; I/Y = 4.01; CPT PV; PV = $105.94
PV – can be calculated as:
N = 7; FV = 100; PMT = 4; I/Y = 3.99; CPT PV; PV = $106.06
The price value of a basis point can be computed as:
PVBP = (106.06 − 105.94) / 2 = $0.06 per 100 of par value

102. Consider the following statements:
Statement 1: All other things remaining the same, a bond with higher convexity will outperform
one with lower convexity in both bull and bear markets.
Statement 2: Callable bonds exhibit negative convexity at low yields, but traditional fixed‐rate
bonds and putable bonds exhibit positive convexity at all yield levels.
Which of the following is most likely?
A. Only Statement 1 is correct.
B. Only Statement 2 is correct.
C. Both statements are correct.
Answer: C
The greater the convexity of a bond, the greater the price appreciation when yields decrease and
the lower the price depreciation when yields increase.
Callable bonds exhibit negative convexity at low yield levels. As it becomes increasingly likely
that the issuer will exercise the embedded call option, the call price acts as a cap on the bond’s
value and the slope of the price‐yield profile flattens (the rate of change of duration becomes
negative). Traditional fixed‐rate bonds and putable bonds always have positive convexity.
103. If the coupon rate on a bond is greater than its current yield, the bond is most likely trading at
A. A premium.
B. A discount.
C. Par.
Answer: A
When the coupon rate on a bond is greater than its current yield, the bond is trading at a premium
to its par value.
104. The annual yield‐to‐maturity, stated with a periodicity of 4, for a five‐year, zero‐coupon bond
prices at 65 per 100 of par value is closest to:
A. 2.177%.
B. 2.25%.
C. 8.71%.
© Wiley 2017 All Rights Reserved. Any unauthorized copying or distribution will constitute an infringement of copyright.166
Answer: C
PV = FV / (1 + r)N
65 = 100 / (1 + r)4×5
r = 2.177%
More simply: N = 20; FV = 100; PV = –65; CPT I/Y; I/Y = 2.177%
2.177% × 4 = 8.71%

Questions 105–110 relate to Derivatives
105. A synthetic zero-coupon risk‐free bond can be constructed by going:
A. Long on a put and call option, and short on the underlying stock.
B. Long on a call option and the underlying stock, and short on a put option.
C. Long on a put option and the underlying stock, and short on a call option.
Answer: C
A synthetic zero-coupon risk‐free bond can be created by going long on a put option and the
underlying stock and going short on a call option. X / (1 + Rf)T = P + S − C
106. The fixed-rate payer on a plain-vanilla interest rate swap will most likely receive a payment on a
settlement date if the swap fixed rate:
A. Is greater than the floating rate on the settlement date.
B. Is lower than the floating rate on the settlement date.
C. Was lower than the floating rate on the previous settlement date.
Answer: C
Payments on interest rate swaps are based on the floating rate at the previous settlement date
(t-1). The fixed-rate payer would receive a payment if the swap fixed rate were lower than the
floating rate.
107. All other factors constant, an increase in volatility of the underlying will most likely:
A. Increase the price of calls, but decrease the price of puts.
B. Decrease the price of calls, but decrease the price of puts.
C. Increase the prices of both calls and puts.
Answer: C
An increase in volatility of the underlying increases the value of both calls and puts.

Which of the following is most likely if the underlying on the options is a non-dividend-paying
stock?
A. Both statements are correct.
B. Both statements are incorrect.
C. Only Statement 2 is incorrect.
Answer: C
• At times it may be beneficial to exercise an American option on a dividend-paying stock
early. However, there is never a reason to exercise an American call option on a non-
dividend-paying stock before expiration.
• An American put option may be exercised early if the underlying company is in or
nearing bankruptcy.
109. Consider the following statements:
Statement 1: In a credit default swap, the protection seller is betting that the reference entity will
default.

A. Both statements are correct.
B. Both statements are incorrect.
C. Only one statement is correct.
Answer: C
• In a credit default swap, the protection seller is betting that the reference entity will not
default. Effectively, it is providing insurance against credit risk to the protection buyer.
• At expiration, all options are worth their exercise value.

116. Consider the following statements:
Statement 1: A risk‐averse investor can attain a better risk-return tradeoff by investing a portion
of his portfolio in Asset A, which is more risky than his current portfolio, only if the correlation
between his current portfolio and Asset A is negative.
Statement 2: A more risk‐averse investor will have a steeper indifference curve than a less
risk‐averse investor.
Which of the following is most likely?
A. Both statements are correct.
B. Only Statement 2 is correct.
C. Both statements are incorrect.
Answer: B
• A risk‐averse investor can attain a better risk‐return tradeoff by investing a portion of his
portfolio is a more risky asset as long as the correlation between his current portfolio and
the asset is less than 1.
• Statement 2 is correct.

118. Elena wants to evaluate the performance of her portfolio manager and gathers the following
information:
Portfolio Return = RP = 17%
σp = 28%
β = 0.8
Market return = RM = 9%
σm = 19%
Given a risk‐free rate of 6%, the Treynor ratio and M 2 are closest to:
Treynor Ratio M 2 (%)
A. 0.1375 5.21
B. 0.3929 13.21
C. 0.1375 4.46
Answer: C
Treynor ratio = (Rp − Rf) / β = (17% – 6%) / 0.8 = 0.1375
M2 = [(Rp − Rf) × (σm / σp)] – (Rm − Rf)
M2 = [(17% − 6%) × (19% / 28%)] − (9% – 6%) = 4.46%
