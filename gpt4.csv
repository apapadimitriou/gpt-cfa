Which of the following actions by the manager most likely violates Standard I (B): Independence and Objectivity?",Putting Alpha One on a restricted list,Asking Jones to issue a favorable report,Asking Jones to only state facts about the company,B,"According to Standard I (B), if a firm is unwilling to allow dissemination of adverse opinions about a corporate client, it may put the company on a restricted list. This would ensure that the firm only disseminates factual information about the company.",A,"The CFA Institute's Standard I (B): Independence and Objectivity states that a CFA charterholder or candidate must use reasonable care and judgment to achieve and maintain independence and objectivity in their professional activities. They must not offer, solicit, or accept any gift, benefit, compensation, or consideration that reasonably could be expected to compromise their own or another’s independence and objectivity. - In this case, the manager is trying to influence Phil's research report on Alpha One Inc. due to the company's relationship with their firm. This is a clear attempt to compromise Phil's independence and objectivity in his professional activities. - Therefore, the manager's action of trying to prevent Phil from issuing an unfavorable report on Alpha One Inc. most likely violates Standard I (B): Independence and Objectivity.",no
Which of the following is least likely a violation of Standard I (D): Misconduct?,A. Engaging in frequent fights on the trading floor,B. Offering higher-quality services to certain clients,C. Getting intoxicated during office hours,B," Offering premium levels of service to certain clients (without disclosing these premium services and making them available to all clients) is a violation of Standard III (B): Fair Dealing, but not Standard I (D): Misconduct.",C,"Standard I (D): Misconduct in the CFA Institute Code of Ethics and Standards of Professional Conduct refers to the ethical and professional responsibility of CFA charterholders and candidates to avoid any actions that could involve or result in any illegal, unethical, or improper conduct. This standard also includes the responsibility to maintain the integrity of the profession. - Therefore, to answer this question, I need to identify the option that is least likely to involve illegal, unethical, or improper conduct. - Option A: A CFA charterholder uses company resources for personal use. This is likely a violation of Standard I (D) as it involves improper conduct and misuse of company resources. - Option B: A CFA charterholder discloses confidential client information without the client's permission. This is also likely a violation of Standard I (D) as it involves unethical conduct and breach of client confidentiality. - Option C: A CFA charterholder accurately reports his/her performance record. This is least likely a violation of Standard I (D) as it involves proper conduct and honesty in reporting performance.",no
"Martha Stevens, CFA, is an investment manager who uses her friend, Robert James, exclusively for her clients’ brokerage transactions. James provides better services than other brokers in return for a slightly higher price, which Stevens believes is justified. Which of the following statements is most accurate?","A. Stevens is in violation of Standard III (A): Loyalty, Prudence and Care.",B. Stevens is in violation of Standard III (B): Fair Dealing.,C. Stevens has not violated any standard.,C," Stevens is justified in using James as a broker, as the slightly higher charges are justified by the better service.",C,"First, let's understand the scenario. Martha Stevens is an investment manager who uses her friend, Robert James, for all her clients' brokerage transactions. James charges a slightly higher price but provides better services, which Stevens believes is justified. - Next, let's consider the CFA Institute's Standards of Professional Conduct. The standard on Duties to Clients (Standard III) includes a section on Fair Dealing (Standard III(B)). This standard requires that CFA members and candidates deal fairly and objectively with all clients when providing investment analysis, making investment recommendations, taking investment action, or engaging in other professional activities. - Given this, it's important to consider whether Stevens is dealing fairly with her clients by using James exclusively for their brokerage transactions. If James truly provides better services than other brokers, and the slightly higher price is justified by these better services, then it could be argued that Stevens is dealing fairly with her clients. However, if there are other brokers who provide equally good services at a lower price, then Stevens may not be dealing fairly with her clients. - Finally, it's also important to consider the CFA Institute's Standards of Professional Conduct on Disclosure of Conflicts (Standard VI(A)). This standard requires that CFA members and candidates make full and fair disclosure of all matters that could reasonably be expected to impair their independence and objectivity or interfere with their duties to their clients, prospective clients, and employers. If Stevens is using James exclusively because he is her friend, and not solely because he provides better services, then she may be violating this standard. - Without more information, it's difficult to definitively say whether Stevens is violating the CFA Institute's Standards of Professional Conduct. However, based on the information provided, it seems possible that she could be violating the standards on Fair Dealing and/or Disclosure of Conflicts.",yes

Henry violated Standard IV (B): Additional Compensation Arrangements and his boss violated Standard IV (C): Responsibilities of Supervisors.,C, • Henry violated Standard IV (B) by not obtaining written consent from his employer before accepting the gift. • Henry’s boss violated Standard IV (C) by failing to take appropriate action.,A,"First, let's understand the CFA Institute's Code of Ethics and Standards of Professional Conduct. According to the CFA Institute, accepting gifts that could be seen as a conflict of interest is not allowed. This is because it could potentially influence the impartiality of the investment manager's decisions. - In this case, Frank Henry, CFA, accepted a free trip to Mauritius from a client. This could be seen as a conflict of interest, as it could potentially influence his investment decisions for that client. - Even though Henry’s boss did not do anything about the arrangement, it does not make it right or ethical. The boss's inaction could be due to various reasons, such as the importance of the client to the firm, but it does not change the fact that the arrangement is a potential conflict of interest. - Therefore, the most likely scenario is that both Frank Henry and his boss have violated the CFA Institute's Code of Ethics and Standards of Professional Conduct.",no

There are several types of scales used in statistics: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio. - A nominal scale is used for labeling variables, without any quantitative value. For example, gender (male, female) is a nominal scale. - An ordinal scale is used for ranking. The intervals between the ranks may not be equal, but there is a clear order of the variables. For example, ratings of a product (poor, average, good) is an ordinal scale. - An interval scale is used for ranking, but the intervals between the ranks are equal. For example, temperature (in Celsius or Fahrenheit) is an interval scale. - A ratio scale is similar to an interval scale, but it has a clear definition of zero. For example, age is a ratio scale. - In this case, the analyst is rating the stocks as under perform, neutral, or outperform. This is a clear ranking, but there is no indication that the intervals between the ranks are equal. Therefore, this is most likely an ordinal scale.",no

It states that if you have a population with mean μ and standard deviation σ and take sufficiently large random samples from the population with replacement, then the distribution of the sample means will be approximately normally distributed. This will hold true regardless of whether the source population is normal or skewed, provided the sample size is sufficiently large (usually n > 30). - If the population itself is normally distributed, then the theorem is even more powerful: the sample means will be exactly normally distributed, regardless of sample size. - Now, let's consider the options one by one. - Option A: The distribution of sample means will be approximately normally distributed. This is a correct assertion of the central limit theorem. - Option B: The theorem holds true regardless of whether the source population is normal or skewed, provided the sample size is sufficiently large.

The larger the sample size, the narrower the confidence interval because a larger sample size provides more information about the population and reduces the uncertainty. On the other hand, a smaller standard deviation also results in a narrower confidence interval because it indicates less variability in the data. Therefore, the combination of a large sample size and a small standard deviation will most likely result in the narrowest confidence interval.",yes
Which of the following tests is most likely used when testing the variance of a single normally distributed population?,A. T‐test,B. Chi‐square test,C. F‐test,B," The Chi‐square test is used to test the variance of a single normally distributed population. T‐tests are used when conducting tests on the mean, whereas the F‐test is used to test the equality of variance of two populations.",A,"The question is asking about a statistical test that is used to test the variance of a single normally distributed population. There are several statistical tests that can be used to test different aspects of a population, such as the mean, variance, and proportion. However, the question specifically asks about the variance. - The Chi-Square test is often used to test the variance of a single normally distributed population.

Increases both the FV and PV of an amount.,C. Decreases both the FV and PV of an amount.,A, An increase in compounding frequency increases the effective annual rate (EAR). Therefore: • The FV of an amount increases. • The PV of an amount falls.,C,"The question is asking about the effect of increasing the frequency of compounding on the stated annual interest rate. - Compounding is the process of earning interest on both the initial principal and the interest which has been added to your investment. - When the frequency of compounding increases, it means that interest is added to the principal more often. For example, if compounding is done annually, interest is added once a year. If it is done semi-annually, interest is added twice a year. - An increase in the frequency of compounding will result in more interest being added to the principal, and therefore the effective annual rate (EAR) will increase. - However, the stated annual interest rate does not change with the frequency of compounding. It is a fixed rate that is determined at the beginning of the investment period. - Therefore, an increase in the frequency of compounding does not affect the stated annual interest rate.",no

The more frequently interest is compounded, the higher the effective interest rate will be. - The formula to calculate the effective annual rate (EAR) is: EAR = (1 + i/n)^(n*t) - 1, where i is the nominal interest rate, n is the number of compounding periods per year, and t is the number of years. In this case, we know the EAR (6.09%), the nominal interest rate (6%), and the time period (1 year), and we need to solve for n. - Rearranging the formula to solve for n, we get: n = log(1 + EAR) / log(1 + i/n). However, this is a complex equation to solve without knowing the value of n. A simpler approach is to use trial and error to find the value of n that results in an EAR of 6.09%. - Starting with semi-annual compounding (n=2), the formula gives: EAR = (1 + 0.06/2)^(2*1) - 1 = 6.09%.

The formula for CAPM is: Cost of Equity = Risk-Free Rate + Beta * (Market Return - Risk-Free Rate). - In this case, the risk-free rate is the return on government securities, which is 6%. The market return is 12%, and the beta is 1.1. - Substituting these values into the CAPM formula gives: Cost of Equity = 6% + 1.1 * (12% - 6%) = 6% + 1.1 * 6% = 6% + 6.6% = 12.6%. - Next, I need to calculate the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The formula for WACC is: WACC = (Equity / (Equity + Debt)) * Cost of Equity + (Debt / (Equity + Debt)) * Cost of Debt * (1 - Tax Rate). - In this case, the debt-to-equity ratio is 0.4, which means that for every $1 of equity, there is $0.4 of debt. Therefore, the proportion of equity is 1 / (1 + 0.4) = 0.714, and the proportion of debt is 0.4 / (1 + 0.4) = 0.286. - The cost of debt is 7%, and the tax rate is assumed to be 0 because it's not given in the question. - Substituting these values into the WACC formula gives: WACC = 0.714 * 12.6% + 0.286 * 7% * (1 - 0) = 9% + 2% = 11%. - Now that I have the discount rate, I can calculate the net present value (NPV) of the project.

We are asked to find the probability that a student was from the weekend batch given that she failed the exam. This is a conditional probability problem. - We can use Bayes' theorem to solve this problem. Bayes' theorem is a way to find a probability when we know certain other probabilities. The formula is: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B). - In this case, we want to find P(Weekend|Failed), or the probability that a student was from the weekend batch given that she failed the exam. - P(Weekend) is the probability that a student is from the weekend batch, which is 31% or 0.31. - P(Weekday) is the probability that a student is from the weekday batch, which is 69% or 0.69. - P(Failed|Weekend) is the probability that a student failed given that she is from the weekend batch. Since the pass rate for the weekend batch is 63%, the fail rate is 100% - 63% = 37% or 0.37. - P(Failed|Weekday) is the probability that a student failed given that she is from the weekday batch. Since the pass rate for the weekday batch is 52%, the fail rate is 100% - 52% = 48% or 0.48. - P(Failed) is the total probability that a student failed. We can find this by adding the probability that a student failed and is from the weekday batch (P(Failed and Weekday)) and the probability that a student failed and is from the weekend batch (P(Failed and Weekend)). P(Failed and Weekday) = P(Weekday) * P(Failed|Weekday) = 0.69 * 0.48 = 0.3312. P(Failed and Weekend) = P(Weekend) * P(Failed|Weekend) = 0.31 * 0.37 = 0.1147. So, P(Failed) = P(Failed and Weekday) + P(Failed and Weekend) = 0.3312 + 0.1147 = 0.4459. - Now we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem to find P(Weekend|Failed). P(Weekend|Failed) = P(Failed|Weekend) * P(Weekend) / P(Failed) = 0.37 * 0.31 / 0.4459 = 0.257. - So, the probability that a student was from the weekend batch given that she failed the exam is approximately 0.257 or 25.7%.",yes

This is because additional workers are able to specialize and become more efficient, leading to an increase in output per worker. - However, after a certain point, the firm starts to experience decreasing marginal returns. This is because as more and more workers are hired, they start to get in each other's way, leading to a decrease in output per worker. - This pattern of increasing and then decreasing marginal returns gives the marginal product of labor curve its characteristic U-shape. - Therefore, the U-shaped curve that is most likely explained by increasing and decreasing marginal returns to labor is the marginal product of labor curve.",no

Aggregate demand is the total demand for all goods and services in an economy. When AD increases, it means that consumers, businesses, and the government are spending more, which can lead to economic expansion. - During an economic expansion, companies generally see increased profits as demand for their products and services increases. This can lead to higher stock prices, making equities a potentially good investment. - However, an increase in AD can also lead to inflation, as more money chasing the same amount of goods and services can push up prices. Inflation erodes the purchasing power of money, which can be bad for fixed-income investments like bonds. When inflation expectations rise, bond yields also rise to compensate investors for the loss of purchasing power, which leads to a decrease in bond prices. - Real estate can be a mixed bag. On one hand, inflation can increase the value of real estate as replacement costs rise. On the other hand, if inflation leads to higher interest rates, it can increase the cost of borrowing to buy real estate, which could put downward pressure on real estate prices. - Given these considerations, the least likely investment to increase during an economic expansion caused by an increase in AD would be bonds, due to the potential for rising inflation and interest rates.",no

Under which of the following types of trade restrictions is the welfare loss to the importing company most likely to be the lowest?,A. Tariffs,B. Quotas,C. Voluntary export restraints,A," • In a tariff, the welfare loss is reduced by tariff revenue earned by the government. • In a quota, the quota rents may be captured by the importing country or the exporting country. • In a VER, the quota rents are captured by the exporting country.",A,"This question is asking about the impact of different types of trade restrictions on the welfare of an importing company. The welfare of an importing company is typically measured in terms of its profits, which are affected by the costs of importing goods and the prices at which those goods can be sold. - Trade restrictions can take many forms, including tariffs, quotas, and non-tariff barriers. Tariffs are taxes on imported goods, which increase the cost of those goods to the importing company. Quotas are limits on the quantity of goods that can be imported, which can also increase costs by forcing the company to source goods from more expensive domestic or third-country suppliers. Non-tariff barriers include things like import licenses, standards and regulations, and customs procedures, which can increase costs by creating delays and uncertainty. - Of these three types of trade restrictions, tariffs are likely to have the least impact on the welfare of the importing company. This is because tariffs are a predictable cost that can be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. Quotas and non-tariff barriers, on the other hand, can create uncertainty and disrupt supply chains, which can have a larger impact on profits.",yes

If the Fed wants to increase the money supply, it would buy government securities, which increases the reserves of the banks and allows them to lend more. - The discount rate is the interest rate charged to commercial banks for loans received from the Fed. Lowering the discount rate makes borrowing cheaper for banks, which increases their reserves and allows them to lend more, thereby increasing the money supply. - Reserve requirements refer to the amount of funds that a bank must hold in reserve against specified deposit liabilities. Lowering the reserve requirements allows banks to lend more of their deposits, thereby increasing the money supply. - Therefore, if the Fed wants to increase the money supply, it is least likely to sell government securities (which would decrease the money supply), raise the discount rate (which would make borrowing more expensive and decrease the money supply), or raise the reserve requirements (which would decrease the amount of money banks can lend).",no

This can be in terms of goods, services, or even financial transfers. It's a measure of a country's net income earned on international assets. So, to answer this question, I need to think about what would least likely lead to a country exporting more than it imports. - Option A: High domestic savings rates. If a country has high domestic savings rates, it means that its citizens are saving a lot of their income rather than spending it. This could lead to less domestic consumption, which could in turn lead to more exports (since goods and services not consumed domestically could be sold internationally). So, this option could potentially lead to a current account surplus. - Option B: High domestic investment. If a country has high domestic investment, it means that a lot of money is being put into domestic businesses and industries. This could potentially lead to more production, which could in turn lead to more exports. However, it could also lead to more imports if the investments are in industries that require a lot of imported goods or services. So, this option could potentially lead to either a current account surplus or a current account deficit, depending on the specifics. - Option C: High domestic consumption. If a country has high domestic consumption, it means that its citizens are spending a lot of their income on goods and services. This could lead to more imports (since goods and services consumed domestically have to come from somewhere, and if they're not produced domestically, they have to be imported). So, this option would most likely lead to a current account deficit, not a surplus.",no

Improves Increases,C," Under the revaluation model (IFRS), if the upward revaluation is reversing a previous downward revaluation, the gain flows through the income statement (to increase net income) and then increases shareholders’ equity. If the upward revaluation is not reversing a previous downward revaluation, the gain flows through the revaluation surplus and increases shareholders’ equity directly. • In 2015, assets increase along with shareholders’ equity so reported leverage ratios improve (decrease). • The return on equity also increases as net income and shareholders’ equity both increase. The numerator effect dominates and results in an increase in the ratio.",A,"First, let's understand what leverage and return on equity (ROE) are. Leverage is a measure of how much debt a company uses to finance its assets. It's calculated as total debt divided by total equity. ROE is a measure of profitability, calculated as net income divided by shareholders' equity. - Next, let's consider the impact of an upward revaluation of an asset. An upward revaluation of an asset increases the total assets on the balance sheet. If the company has not taken on additional debt, this means that the equity of the company has increased. - An increase in equity would decrease the leverage ratio, because the denominator of the leverage ratio (equity) has increased while the numerator (debt) has remained the same. - An increase in equity would also increase the ROE, because the denominator of the ROE (equity) has increased, assuming that net income remains the same. - So, an upward revaluation of an asset would most likely decrease reported leverage and increase return on equity.",no

To calculate this, we need to understand the relationship between income tax expense, deferred tax liabilities, and deferred tax assets. - Income tax expense is the total amount of tax expense that the company reports on its income statement. This includes both current taxes payable and changes in deferred tax accounts. - Deferred tax liabilities represent taxes that the company expects to pay in the future. A decrease in deferred tax liabilities means that the company has less tax to pay in the future, which effectively increases the current tax payable. - Deferred tax assets represent taxes that the company has overpaid and can recover in the future. An increase in deferred tax assets means that the company has overpaid its taxes, which effectively decreases the current tax payable. - So, to calculate the taxes payable, we start with the income tax expense and adjust for the changes in deferred tax accounts. The formula is: Taxes Payable = Income Tax Expense - Increase in Deferred Tax Assets + Decrease in Deferred Tax Liabilities. - Substituting the given values into the formula, we get: Taxes Payable = $25,000 - $5,000 + $12,500 = $32,500.",no

These include service cost, interest cost, actual return on plan assets, actuarial gains and losses, and contributions by the employer. - Service cost and interest cost are typically recognized in the income statement. Actual return on plan assets is also usually recognized in the income statement, but it can be recognized in other comprehensive income if the company chooses to use the corridor approach. - Actuarial gains and losses are typically recognized in other comprehensive income. This is because they result from changes in the assumptions used to calculate the pension obligation, such as changes in the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, and employee turnover, retirement age, and mortality rate. These changes are unpredictable and can be significant, so recognizing them in other comprehensive income allows the company to smooth out its reported pension expense. - Contributions by the employer are recognized as a decrease in the company's cash and an increase in the plan assets, so they do not affect the net pension asset/liability. - Therefore, the source of changes in the net pension asset/liability that is most likely to be recognized in other comprehensive income is actuarial gains and losses.",no

A deferred tax liability is an amount that a company owes to the tax authorities in the future, while a deferred tax asset is an amount that a company has overpaid and is thus owed by the tax authorities. These arise due to differences in accounting methods for financial reporting and tax purposes. - Next, let's calculate the depreciation for accounting purposes. The machine was purchased for $2.5 million and is depreciated on a 10% straight-line basis. This means that each year, 10% of the machine's value is depreciated. So, for 2008, the depreciation would be $2.5 million * 10% = $250,000. For 2009, after revaluation, the machine's value is $2.6 million, so the depreciation would be $2.6 million * 10% = $260,000. - Then, let's calculate the depreciation for tax purposes. The machine is depreciated on a 15% straight-line basis. So, for 2008, the depreciation would be $2.5 million * 15% = $375,000. For 2009, the revaluation is not recognized for tax purposes, so the machine's value is still $2.5 million, and the depreciation would be $2.5 million * 15% = $375,000. - Now, let's calculate the difference in depreciation for 2009. The depreciation for accounting purposes is $260,000, and for tax purposes it is $375,000. So, the difference is $375,000 - $260,000 = $115,000. This is the amount that is over-depreciated for tax purposes, and thus creates a deferred tax liability. - Finally, let's calculate the deferred tax liability.

These securities include stock options, convertible bonds, warrants, and convertible preferred stock. - Next, we need to understand how to calculate the number of inferred shares for diluted EPS. For warrants and options, we use the treasury stock method. This method assumes that the proceeds that a company receives from an in-the-money option exercise are used to repurchase common shares in the market. - For the warrants: The exercise price is $35, which is less than the average market price of $40. Therefore, these warrants are in-the-money and will be exercised. The proceeds from the exercise of these warrants would be 10,000 shares * $35/share = $350,000.

Which of the following ratios is most likely lower in the early years of an asset’s life if the company uses the straight-line method instead of the double declining balance method for depreciation?,A. Operating profit margin,B. Operating return on assets,C. Asset turnover,C," If a company uses straight line depreciation, it will report: • Lower asset turnover (due to higher net assets). • Higher operating profit margin (due to lower depreciation expense). • Higher operating ROA (due to lower depreciation expense). Questions 69–78 relate to Corporate Finance",A,"The question is asking about the impact of different depreciation methods on financial ratios in the early years of an asset's life. The two methods mentioned are the straight-line method and the double declining balance method. - The straight-line method of depreciation spreads the cost of the asset evenly over its useful life. This means that the depreciation expense is the same every year. - The double declining balance method, on the other hand, results in higher depreciation expenses in the early years of the asset's life and lower expenses in the later years. This is because it applies a higher rate of depreciation to the asset's remaining book value each year. - Given these differences, we can infer that in the early years of an asset's life, using the double declining balance method would result in a higher depreciation expense compared to the straight-line method. - This higher depreciation expense would reduce the company's net income, which in turn would lower any ratios that use net income in the numerator. This includes ratios like return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE). - On the other hand, ratios that use assets or equity in the denominator, like the debt-to-equity ratio or the equity multiplier, would not be affected by the depreciation method because depreciation affects both the numerator and the denominator of these ratios equally. - Finally, ratios that use the book value of assets in the numerator, like the book value per share, would be higher in the early years under the double declining balance method because this method results in a lower book value of assets compared to the straight-line method.",no

Project B has higher total cash inflows.,B. Project A receives most of its cash flows later in its life.,C. Project A has a higher IRR.,B, The steeper NPV profile indicates that: • Project A has higher total expected cash flows (higher y‐intercept). • More of Project A’s cash flows come later in its life. • Project A has a lower IRR (lower x‐intercept).,A,"The NPV profile is a graph that shows the relationship between a project's net present value (NPV) and the discount rate. The steeper the NPV profile, the more sensitive the project's NPV is to changes in the discount rate. - The crossover point on the NPV profile is the discount rate at which the NPVs of two projects are equal. If Project A's NPV profile is steeper than Project B's, it means that Project A's NPV decreases more rapidly than Project B's as the discount rate increases. - Therefore, if the crossover point occurs at an NPV of $5,000, it means that at this discount rate, both projects have an NPV of $5,000.

A drag on liquidity is most likely to occur when:,A. There is a delay in cash coming into the company.,B. Cash leaves the company too quickly.,C. The company loses creditworthiness.,A, A drag on liquidity is most likely to occur when there is a delay in cash coming into the company.,B,"A drag on liquidity refers to a situation where a company's liquidity is reduced. This can occur due to several reasons. - One common reason is when a company's current liabilities exceed its current assets. This means the company has more short-term obligations than it has short-term resources to meet them. - Another reason could be when a company has a high level of debt. High debt levels can reduce a company's liquidity as it has to use its resources to service the debt. - A third reason could be when a company has slow inventory turnover. If a company's inventory is not selling quickly, it can tie up resources and reduce liquidity.",no
Consider the following statements: Statement 1: Dual-class share structures can easily be changed over time.

It is very important for long-term investors to consider how activist investors affect the company, as they can materially change a company’s strategic direction.",C,"Let's consider each statement separately. Statement 1 suggests that dual-class share structures can easily be changed over time. However, this is generally not the case. Dual-class share structures, which allow for different voting rights among shareholders, are typically established at the company's inception and are difficult to change without the agreement of the majority of shareholders, particularly those with superior voting rights. Therefore, this statement is likely incorrect. - Statement 2 suggests that activist investors tend to have little impact on the company’s long-term investors. This is also generally not the case. Activist investors, who buy shares in a company and use their stake to influence management decisions, can have a significant impact on a company's strategy and performance, and therefore on its long-term investors.

The formula for CAPM is: Cost of Equity = Risk-free rate + Beta * (Market return - Risk-free rate). - Substituting the given values into the formula, we get: Cost of Equity = 0.06 + 1.2 * (0.12 - 0.06) = 0.132 or 13.2%. - Next, we need to calculate the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC). The formula for WACC is: WACC = (Cost of Equity * Equity portion) + (After-tax cost of debt * Debt portion). - Given that the target debt-to-equity ratio is 0.4, the equity portion is 1 / (1 + Debt-to-equity ratio) = 1 / (1 + 0.4) = 0.7143 or 71.43% and the debt portion is 1 - Equity portion = 1 - 0.7143 = 0.2857 or 28.57%. - Substituting the values into the WACC formula, we get: WACC = (0.132 * 0.7143) + (0.07 * 0.2857) = 0.0943 or 9.43%.",no

The all-inclusive rate is 9%, but this is an annual rate. We need to adjust this rate to reflect the one-month borrowing period. - To do this, we can use the formula for the effective annual rate (EAR), which is (1 + i/n)^(nt) - 1, where i is the nominal interest rate (in this case, 9% or 0.09), n is the number of compounding periods per year (in this case, 12, because we're dealing with months), and t is the number of years (in this case, 1/12, because we're dealing with one month). - Substituting the values into the formula, we get (1 + 0.09/12)^(12*(1/12)) - 1. - This simplifies to (1 + 0.0075)^1 - 1, which equals 0.0075 or 0.75%. - So, the effective borrowing cost for the one-month period is 0.75%.",no
Aztec Ltd. is considering investing $650 million in a new project.

The company is considering investing in a new project, and we're given the present value of the net cash flows from the project, the number of shares outstanding, and the current market price per share. We're asked to find the new price per share if the company undertakes the project. - Next, we need to calculate the total market value of the company before the project. This is done by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the current market price per share. So, 7 million shares * $120/share = $840 million. - Then, we need to calculate the total market value of the company after the project. This is done by adding the present value of the net cash flows from the project to the total market value of the company before the project. So, $840 million + $800 million = $1,640 million. - Finally, we need to calculate the new price per share after the project.

Which of the following types of market indices has a contrarian effect on portfolio weights?,A. Fundamental weighting,B. Price weighting,C. Market value weighting,A, Fundamental weighting leads to a contrarian effect in that portfolio weights move away from securities whose prices have risen (as higher prices result in a lower earnings yield). Market value weighting results in the weight of a security in the index heading in the same direction as its price (momentum effect).,C,"A market index is a hypothetical portfolio of investment holdings which represents a segment of the financial market. The calculation of the index value comes from the prices of the selected stocks. There are three types of market indices: price-weighted, value-weighted, and equal-weighted. - Price-weighted indices are affected by the price of each individual stock, not the total market capitalization of each company. Therefore, a high-priced stock would have a greater impact on the index's performance than a low-priced stock, regardless of the company's actual size. - Value-weighted indices, also known as market capitalization-weighted indices, consider the size of the company as well as the share price. This means that price changes in small companies will not affect the index value as much as price changes in larger companies. - Equal-weighted indices assign the same weight to all issues regardless of their price or market capitalization. This means that a 1% move in a small company will have the same effect as a 1% move in a large company. - The question asks for the type of index that has a contrarian effect on portfolio weights. A contrarian investment strategy is one that is contrary to the prevailing sentiment of the time. It involves buying and selling in contrast to the prevailing market trends. - Therefore, the equal-weighted index would have a contrarian effect on portfolio weights because it gives the same importance to small companies as it does to large companies, which is contrary to the prevailing market sentiment that larger companies should have a greater impact on the value of the index.",no

The following information is also available: Dividend received on the stock = $0.5 per share Commission paid = $0.15 per share Leverage ratio = 2.5 Call money rate = 6.5% Government bill rate = 6% The total return on Emanuel’s investment is closest to:,A. 30.00%.,B. 15.56%.,C. 24.62%.,A," Total purchase price = 130 × 45 = $5,850 Proportion of equity investment = 1 / 2.5 = 40% Equity investment = 1 / 2.5 × 5,850 = $2,340 Therefore, amount borrowed = 5,850 − 2,340 = $3,510 Commission paid on purchase transaction = 130 × 0.15 = $19.5 Total investment = 2,340 + 19.5 = $2,359.5 Equity remaining after the sale is calculated as follows: Proceeds on sale 6,760 (130 × 52) Payoff loan –3,510 Margin interest paid –228.15 (3,510 × 6.5%) Dividends received 65 (130 × 0.5) Sales commission paid –19.5 (130 × 0.15) Remaining equity 3,067.35 Therefore, total return = (3,067.35 − 2,359.5) / 2,359.5 = 30%",C,"First, let's calculate the total cost of the shares Emanuel purchased. This is done by multiplying the number of shares by the purchase price per share. So, 130 shares * $45/share = $5,850. - Next, let's calculate the total amount Emanuel received when she sold her shares. This is done by multiplying the number of shares by the selling price per share. So, 130 shares * $52/share = $6,760. - Then, let's calculate the total dividends received. This is done by multiplying the number of shares by the dividend per share. So, 130 shares * $0.5/share = $65. - Next, let's calculate the total commission paid. This is done by multiplying the number of shares by the commission per share. So, 130 shares * $0.15/share = $19.5. - Now, let's calculate the total return on Emanuel’s investment. This is done by adding the total amount received from selling the shares and the total dividends received, then subtracting the total cost of the shares and the total commission paid. So, $6,760 + $65 - $5,850 - $19.5 = $955.5. - However, since Emanuel purchased the shares on margin, she borrowed money to buy the shares. The leverage ratio is 2.5, which means she borrowed 2.5 times the amount of her own money. So, the amount of her own money is $5,850 / 2.5 = $2,340. - The interest on the borrowed money is calculated by multiplying the borrowed amount by the call money rate. So, ($5,850 - $2,340) * 6.5% = $228.15. - Finally, the total return on Emanuel’s investment, taking into account the interest on the borrowed money, is $955.5 - $228.15 = $727.35. - The total return as a percentage is calculated by dividing the total return by the amount of her own money and multiplying by 100. So, $727.35 / $2,340 * 100 = 31.09%.",no

"Consider the following statements: Statement 1: Generally speaking, floating‐rate notes have less interest rate risk than fixed‐rate bonds. Statement 2: The spread on a floating‐rate note varies with the issuer’s creditworthiness during the term of the bond. Which of the following is most likely?",A. Both statements are incorrect.,B. Only Statement 1 is correct.,C. Only Statement 2 is correct.,B, FRN’s have lower interest rate risk than fixed‐rate bonds because the coupon rate on a FRN is reset periodically and brought in line with market interest rates. The spread on a floating‐rate note is determined at issuance based on the issuer’s creditworthiness at issuance.,C,"Let's consider each statement separately. Statement 1 says that floating-rate notes have less interest rate risk than fixed-rate bonds. This is generally true because the interest payments on floating-rate notes are adjusted periodically based on a reference interest rate, such as LIBOR. Therefore, the value of these notes is less sensitive to changes in market interest rates compared to fixed-rate bonds, which pay a fixed interest rate throughout their life. - Statement 2 says that the spread on a floating-rate note varies with the issuer’s creditworthiness during the term of the bond. This is also generally true. The spread on a floating-rate note is the difference between the interest rate on the note and the reference interest rate. This spread compensates the investor for the credit risk of the issuer. If the issuer's creditworthiness deteriorates during the term of the bond, the spread will likely increase to compensate for the increased risk. - Based on this analysis, both statements are generally true.",no
"Consider the following statements: Statement 1: The option embedded in a putable bond is more likely to be exercised by the issuer when interest rates rise. Statement 2: If a bond is sold between coupon payment dates, accrued interest is due to the buyer. Which of the following is most likely?",A. Both statements are incorrect.,B. Only Statement 1 is correct.,C. Only Statement 2 is correct.,A," The embedded option in a putable bond is likely to be exercised by the investor when interest rates rise. If a bond is traded between coupon payment dates, accrued interest is due to the seller.",B,"Let's consider each statement separately. Statement 1: The option embedded in a putable bond is more likely to be exercised by the issuer when interest rates rise. This statement is incorrect. A putable bond gives the bondholder the right, but not the obligation, to sell the bond back to the issuer at a predetermined price before maturity. The bondholder is more likely to exercise this option when interest rates rise, as they can then reinvest the proceeds at a higher rate. The issuer has no control over whether the option is exercised. - Statement 2: If a bond is sold between coupon payment dates, accrued interest is due to the buyer. This statement is correct. When a bond is sold between coupon payment dates, the seller owes the buyer the accrued interest. This is because the buyer will receive the full coupon payment at the next coupon payment date, but part of that payment is for the period of time when the seller still owned the bond. - Based on the above analysis, only Statement 2 is correct.",no
Consider the following statements: Statement 1: The drawback of credit‐linked bonds is that they can contribute to further downgrades or eventual default of the issuer. Statement 2: TIPS offer investors a fixed real return that is protected from inflation risk. Which of the following is most likely?,A. Only Statement 1 is correct.,B. Only Statement 2 is correct.,C. Both statements are correct.,C," Becausea rating downgrade results in higher interest payments on credit‐linked bonds, they can contribute to further downgrades or even an eventual default of the issuer. Treasury Inflation Protection Securities are inflation‐linked bonds. They are long-term assets with a fixed real return that is protected from inflation risk.",C,"Let's consider each statement separately. Statement 1 suggests that credit-linked bonds can contribute to further downgrades or eventual default of the issuer. This is true because credit-linked bonds are structured products where the issuer's credit risk is transferred to the bondholders. If the issuer's credit rating deteriorates, the value of the bond can decrease, potentially leading to further downgrades or even default. - Statement 2 suggests that TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) offer investors a fixed real return that is protected from inflation risk. This is also true. TIPS are U.S. government securities whose principal is adjusted by changes in the Consumer Price Index. With inflation (a rise in the index), the principal increases. At maturity, the investor is paid the adjusted principal or original principal, whichever is greater. This means that TIPS provide protection against inflation, offering a fixed real return. - Since both statements are correct, the most likely answer is that both statements are true.",yes
"A 7% U.S. corporate bond is priced for settlement on May 18, 2015. The bond makes semiannual coupon payments on January 20 and July 20 of each year and matures on July 20, 2019. The bond uses the 30/360 day‐count convention for accrued interest. Given that stated annual yield‐ to‐maturity is 6.5%, the flat price of the bond per 100 of par value on May 18, 2015 is closest to:",A. $101.7892.,B. $103.7054.,C. $104.0386.,A," Given the 30/360 day‐count convention, there are 118 days between the last coupon on January 20, 2015, and the settlement date on May 28, 2015 (10 days between January 20 and January 30, plus 90 days for the full months of February, March, and April, plus 18 days in May). Therefore, the fraction of the coupon period that has gone by equals 118/180. As of the last coupon payment date, there are 4.5 years (and nine semiannual periods) remaining until maturity. Using stated annual yield‐to‐maturity of 6.5%, or 3.25% per semiannual period, the price of the bond as of the last coupon payment date is calculated as: N = 9; PMT = –$3.50; FV = –$100; I/Y = 3.25%; CPT PV; PV = 101.924 The full price on May 18 is calculated as: PVFull = 101.924 × (1.0325)118/180 = $104.0836 The accrued interest is calculated as: AI = 118 / 180 × 3.50 = $2.2944 The flat price is calculated as: PV Flat = 104.0836 − 2.2944 = $101.7892",C,"First, I need to understand the question. It's asking for the flat price of the bond, which is the price of the bond without considering the accrued interest. - Next, I need to calculate the present value of the bond's future cash flows, which include the semiannual coupon payments and the face value at maturity. The bond's coupon rate is 7%, so each semiannual payment is 7%/2 = 3.5% of the face value. The bond matures in 2019, so there are 4*2 = 8 periods left until maturity. - The yield-to-maturity is given as 6.5% per annum, but since payments are semiannual, I need to divide this by 2 to get the discount rate per period, which is 6.5%/2 = 3.25%. - Now, I can calculate the present value of the future cash flows. The present value of the coupon payments is 3.5% * (1 - (1 + 3.25%)^-8) / 3.25% = 24.96. The present value of the face value at maturity is 100 / (1 + 3.25%)^8 = 78.35. - Adding these two values together, I get the flat price of the bond: 24.96 + 78.35 = 103.31.",no

Only Statement 2 is correct.,C," • Given the term to maturity, a putable corporate bond may actually offer a lower yield than a U.S. Treasury. • Statement 2 is correct, as U.S. Treasures have an element of reinvestment risk among other risks.",B,"Let's analyze each statement separately. Statement 1 suggests that a corporate bond cannot offer a lower yield than a U.S. Treasury given the same term to maturity. This is generally true because corporate bonds carry more risk than U.S. Treasuries, and therefore, investors require a higher yield to compensate for the additional risk. However, there could be exceptions in certain market conditions. - Statement 2 suggests that U.S. Treasuries are free of credit risk, but not risk-free. This is also generally true. U.S. Treasuries are considered free of credit risk because they are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. However, they are not risk-free because they are still subject to interest rate risk and inflation risk. - Given these analyses, both statements are generally true. However, the question asks which statement is 'most likely'. This implies that one of the statements may not always hold true. - Considering this, Statement 1 may not always hold true because in certain market conditions, a corporate bond could potentially offer a lower yield than a U.S. Treasury.

Given the current level of interest rates, Bond A must be the higher coupon bond as it is undergoing “price compression.” Bond A is likely to be called, as its coupon rate is greater than market yields. • Bond B exhibits positive convexity. It is not in danger of being called so its coupon rate must be lower than current market interest rates.",A,"First, let's understand what callable bonds are. Callable bonds are bonds that can be redeemed by the issuer prior to its maturity. If interest rates fall, the issuer can call the bond to refinance the debt at a lower interest rate, which is beneficial for the issuer but not for the bondholder. - Next, let's look at the effect of interest rate changes on bond prices. When interest rates rise, bond prices fall, and vice versa. This is because as interest rates increase, new bonds come to market paying higher coupon rates than existing bonds, making those existing bonds less attractive so their prices drop. - Given this, we can infer that a bond with a higher coupon rate would be less sensitive to interest rate changes. This is because the higher coupon payments provide a buffer against interest rate increases. Therefore, the bond with the smaller percentage change in price for a given change in interest rates would be the higher coupon bond. - Looking at the given data, Bond A has a smaller percentage change in price for a given change in interest rates (-6% for a 100 bps increase and +4% for a 100 bps decrease) compared to Bond B (-8% for a 100 bps increase and +11% for a 100 bps decrease). - Therefore, Bond A is most likely the higher coupon bond.",yes

This provides a cushion for the investors in case the issuer defaults. - Subordination of tranches is when the issuer divides the debt into different tranches with varying levels of risk. The senior tranches are paid first and are therefore less risky, while the junior tranches are paid last and are therefore more risky. - Reserve funds are funds set aside by the issuer to cover potential losses. This provides a safety net for the investors. - However, the question is asking for the least likely method of internal credit enhancement.

Consider the following statements: Statement 1: Any coupon income received from a bond during the term of the repo belongs to the buyer. Statement 2: The repo margin serves to protect the seller against a decline in the value of the collateral over the term of the repo. Which of the following is most likely?,A. Only Statement 1 is correct.,B. Only Statement 2 is correct.,C. Both statements are incorrect.,C, Any coupon income received from a bond during the term of the repo belongs to the seller (borrower). The repo margin serves to protect the buyer (lender) against a decline in the value of the collateral over the term of the repo. Questions 105–110 relate to Derivatives,A,"First, let's consider Statement 1: 'Any coupon income received from a bond during the term of the repo belongs to the buyer.' In a repurchase agreement (repo), the seller sells securities to the buyer with an agreement to repurchase them at a later date. The buyer, in essence, lends money to the seller and holds the seller's securities as collateral. If a bond is the collateral and it pays a coupon during the term of the repo, the income from that coupon does indeed belong to the buyer. So, Statement 1 is correct. - Next, let's consider Statement 2: 'The repo margin serves to protect the seller against a decline in the value of the collateral over the term of the repo.' The repo margin, or haircut, is the difference between the market value of the collateral and the value of the loan. It serves to protect the buyer, not the seller, against a decline in the value of the collateral. If the value of the collateral falls, the buyer still has the repo margin as a buffer before they lose any money. So, Statement 2 is incorrect. - Given the analysis of the two statements, the most likely answer is that Statement 1 is correct and Statement 2 is incorrect.",no

The time value of money and the risk aversion of investors are reflected in the discount rate.,B,"The spot price of an asset is the current market price at which an asset can be bought or sold for immediate delivery. It is determined by the supply and demand for the asset in the market. - In a market with perfect competition, the spot price should reflect all available information. Therefore, any factor that affects the supply or demand for the asset could potentially affect its spot price. - However, if an asset entails no costs nor offers any benefits, factors such as the cost of carry (i.e., the cost of holding the asset) or the income generated by the asset (e.g., dividends for stocks, interest for bonds) would not affect its spot price. - Similarly, the risk-free rate, which is often used to discount future cash flows in the valuation of an asset, would not affect the spot price of an asset that does not generate any cash flows. - Finally, the expected future price of the asset could affect its current spot price, as investors may be willing to pay a premium for the asset today if they expect its price to increase in the future. - Based on these considerations, the factor that least likely affects the spot price of an asset that entails no costs nor offers any benefits is the risk-free rate.",no
"Susan wants to insure her portfolio against losses, while continuing to benefit from any appreciation in the value of her portfolio. She is most likely to pursue:",A. A protective put strategy.,B. A covered call strategy.,C. An interest rate collar.,A, A protective put strategy protects investors on the downside (as they are long on put options). They also continue to participate in the upside of the stock (as they continue to hold the underlying stock).,A,"Susan wants to protect her portfolio from losses but also wants to benefit from any potential gains. This is a common strategy in risk management and there are several financial instruments that can help achieve this. - One such instrument is a protective put. A protective put is a risk-management strategy using options contracts that investors employ to guard against the loss of owning a stock or asset. The protective put establishes a 'floor' price, beneath which the investor's portfolio won't fall. If the portfolio does fall below the floor, the losses are offset by gains in the put option. - Another instrument could be a collar strategy. A collar strategy uses options to limit the range of possible returns on a security or portfolio. The investor buys an out-of-the-money put option, which will protect against a decrease in the price of the security, and sells an out-of-the-money call option, which will limit the potential upside gain. - Finally, a covered call is a financial market transaction in which the seller of call options owns the corresponding amount of the underlying instrument, such as shares of a stock or other securities. If a trader buys the underlying instrument at the same time the trader sells the call, the strategy is often called a 'buy-write' strategy. In equilibrium, a covered call will have the same risk profile as a naked put, but the latter strategy is often seen as more risky due to the potential for the underlying to fall to zero, and the fact that the maximum potential upside is limited. - Given these options, a protective put seems to be the best fit for Susan's needs. It provides protection against losses and allows for unlimited potential gains.",yes

Note that in the equity market, in a margin transaction, the amount that must be deposited to satisfy a margin call should restore the maintenance margin.",A,"The futures market operates on a system of margining, which requires traders to deposit an initial margin with the broker. This margin acts as a guarantee for the performance of the trader's obligations. If the market moves against the trader's position, the trader may receive a margin call, which requires her to deposit additional funds into her margin account. - The question is asking what the balance in the trader's account must be after she receives a margin call and makes the necessary deposit. The options are: A) initial margin, B) maintenance margin, or C) variation margin. - The initial margin is the amount of money that the trader must deposit when she first enters into a futures contract. The maintenance margin is the minimum amount of equity that must be maintained in the margin account. If the balance in the margin account falls below the maintenance margin, the trader receives a margin call and must deposit additional funds to bring the balance back up to the initial margin. - The variation margin is the amount of money that the trader must deposit to cover her losses if the market moves against her position. However, the variation margin is not relevant to this question because it is not a minimum requirement for the balance in the margin account. - Therefore, after receiving a margin call, the trader must deposit enough funds to bring the balance in her margin account back up to the initial margin.",yes
"The underlying on an American call option is a stock that is currently trading at $65. The option has an exercise price of $60, it expires in three months, and the risk‐free rate is 5%. The minimum value of this option is closest to:",A. $5.73.,B. $5.,C. $7.86.,A, Minimum value of American call = 65 − [60 / (1.05)3/12] = $5.73,A,"The minimum value of an American call option can be calculated using the formula: Max(0, S - X), where S is the current stock price and X is the exercise price. This is because the holder of the option would not exercise it if the stock price is less than the exercise price, hence the Max(0, S - X). - In this case, the current stock price (S) is $65 and the exercise price (X) is $60. So, the minimum value of the option is Max(0, $65 - $60) = $5.",yes
Henry sold a call option with an exercise price of $75 for $4. Henry’s profit if the stock trades at $81 at option expiration is closest to:,A. $6 loss.,B. $10 profit.,C. $2 loss.,C, Call option writer’s profit (loss) = payoff + premium = 75 − 81 + 4 = –$2 Questions 111–114 relate to Alternative Investments,B,"First, let's understand the scenario. Henry sold a call option, which gives the buyer the right to buy the stock at the exercise price of $75. Henry received a premium of $4 for selling this option. - The stock is trading at $81 at option expiration. This means the buyer of the call option will exercise the option, as they can buy the stock for $75 (the exercise price) and sell it immediately for $81 (the current market price). - Henry, as the seller of the call option, is obligated to sell the stock at the exercise price of $75. Since the market price is $81, Henry is effectively selling the stock for $6 less than the market price. - However, Henry received a premium of $4 for selling the option. So, we need to subtract this from the $6 loss to calculate Henry's overall profit or loss. - The calculation is: -$6 (loss from selling the stock below market price) + $4 (premium received) = -$2. This means Henry has a loss of $2 per share.",no
Which of the following is least likely a source of return from a collateralized commodity futures position?,A. Spot price return,B. Collateral yield,C. Storage costs,C," The sources of return from a collateralized commodities futures position are roll yield, collateral yield, and spot price return.",C,"A collateralized commodity futures position is a type of investment where an investor takes a long position in a futures contract and simultaneously invests in risk-free securities that are equal to the value of the futures contract. The return from this type of investment comes from three main sources: the risk-free rate of return, the change in the spot price of the commodity, and the roll yield. - The risk-free rate of return is the return that an investor would expect to earn on a risk-free investment, such as a government bond. This is a guaranteed source of return for a collateralized commodity futures position, as the investor is holding risk-free securities as collateral. - The change in the spot price of the commodity is another source of return. If the spot price of the commodity increases, the investor can sell the futures contract at a higher price and earn a profit. However, if the spot price decreases, the investor will incur a loss. - The roll yield is the return that an investor earns from rolling over the futures contract. This occurs when the futures contract is nearing its expiration date and the investor decides to sell the current contract and buy a new one with a later expiration date. The roll yield is positive if the futures price is lower than the spot price (backwardation), and negative if the futures price is higher than the spot price (contango). - Given these three sources of return, the least likely source of return would be the one that is not guaranteed and is subject to market conditions. The risk-free rate of return is guaranteed, so it cannot be the least likely source of return. The change in the spot price of the commodity and the roll yield are both subject to market conditions, but the roll yield is more uncertain because it depends on the relationship between the futures price and the spot price, which can change over time. Therefore, the roll yield is the least likely source of return from a collateralized commodity futures position.",yes
"Jupiter Fund of Funds invests $250 million in each of two funds, Venus Hedge Fund and Mars Hedge Fund. Jupiter has a “2 and 10” fee structure. Both hedge funds charge a 2% management fee based on assets under management at the end of the year and a 20% incentive fee, which is calculated net of management fee. After one year, Jupiter’s investments in Venus and Mars are valued at $230 million and $320 million respectively, after accounting for their respective management and incentive fees. The annual return to an investor in Jupiter, net of fees, at the fund of funds level is closest to:",A. 6.80%.,B. 20.00%.,C. 2.63%.,A, End of year capital = $230m + $320m = $550 million Management fee = $550m × 2% = $11 million Incentive fee = ($550m − $500m) × 10% = $5 million Total fees = $11m + $5m = $16 million Investor’s net return = ($550m − $500m − $16m) / $500m = 6.8%,B,"First, I need to understand the fee structure. Jupiter charges a '2 and 10' fee structure, which means a 2% management fee and a 10% incentive fee. However, this question is about the return to an investor in Jupiter, so I need to consider the fees charged by Venus and Mars as well. - Jupiter invested $250 million in each of Venus and Mars, so the total investment is $500 million. - After one year, the investments in Venus and Mars are valued at $230 million and $320 million respectively. This means the total value of the investments is $550 million. - The return on investment is the final value minus the initial investment, divided by the initial investment. So, the return on investment is ($550 million - $500 million) / $500 million = 0.1, or 10%. - But this is before considering the fees charged by Jupiter. Jupiter charges a 2% management fee and a 10% incentive fee. The management fee is based on the total assets under management, which is $550 million, so the management fee is 0.02 * $550 million = $11 million. - The incentive fee is based on the return, which is $50 million, so the incentive fee is 0.1 * $50 million = $5 million. - So, the total fees charged by Jupiter are $11 million + $5 million = $16 million. - The net return to an investor in Jupiter is the gross return minus the fees, divided by the initial investment. So, the net return is ($50 million - $16 million) / $500 million = 0.068, or 6.8%.",no
Consider the following statements: Statement 1: The Sharpe ratio for commodities as an asset class has historically been higher than bonds but lower than stocks. Statement 2: The volatility of commodity prices tends to be higher than the volatility for reported consumer price inflation. Which of the following is most likely?,A. Only Statement 1 is incorrect.,B. Only Statement 2 is incorrect.,C. Both statements are correct.,A," The Sharpe ratio for commodities as an asset class has historically been lower than for both stocks and bonds. Historically, commodities have earned a lower return than stocks and bonds, and have had a higher standard deviation than stocks and bonds.",C,"First, let's understand what each statement is saying. Statement 1 is about the Sharpe ratio, which is a measure of risk-adjusted return. It's saying that commodities have a higher Sharpe ratio than bonds, but lower than stocks. Statement 2 is about the volatility of commodity prices compared to consumer price inflation. - Next, let's consider the nature of each asset class. Commodities are known for their volatility, which is why they can offer high potential returns but also carry high risk. Bonds, on the other hand, are generally considered less risky and offer lower returns. Stocks fall somewhere in between. - Given this, it seems plausible that the Sharpe ratio for commodities could be higher than for bonds but lower than for stocks. This is because the Sharpe ratio takes into account both return and risk, and commodities could offer higher returns than bonds (justifying a higher Sharpe ratio) but also carry higher risk than stocks (justifying a lower Sharpe ratio). - Statement 2 also seems plausible. The prices of commodities can fluctuate widely due to factors like supply and demand imbalances, geopolitical events, and changes in currency values. These factors can cause commodity prices to be more volatile than consumer price inflation, which is a more stable and slow-moving indicator. - So, both statements seem plausible. Therefore, the most likely answer is that both statements are correct.",no
Funds from operations (FFO) for a REIT are most likely calculated as:,A. Net income plus depreciation less gains from sales of real estate plus losses from sales of real estate.,B. Net income plus depreciation less capital expenditures.,C. Net income less gains from sales of real estate plus losses from sales of real estate.,A," FFO, in its most basic form, equals net income plus depreciation charges on real estate property less gains from sales of real estate property plus losses on sales of real estate property. Questions 115–120 relate to Portfolio Management",C,"Funds from operations (FFO) is a measure often used by Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) to define the cash flow from their operations. It's calculated by adding depreciation and amortization to earnings, and sometimes subtracting gains on sales of property. - This is because depreciation and amortization are non-cash expenses that reduce a company's earnings but do not impact its cash flow. On the other hand, gains on sales of property are not a regular part of business operations and can distort the picture of a company's ongoing ability to generate cash. - Therefore, the formula for FFO is: FFO = Net Income + Depreciation and Amortization - Gain on Sale of Property.",no
Consider the following statements: Statement 1: A portfolio on the minimum variance frontier may have a positive or negative weight on the risk‐free asset. Statement 2: An investor with a negative risk-aversion coefficient would have an indifference curve with a negative slope. Which of the following is most likely?,A. Both statements are correct.,B. Only one statement is correct.,C. Both statements are incorrect.,B," Any portfolio on the minimum variance frontier only contains risky assets. The weight of the risk‐free asset is zero. A risk‐averse investor has a negative risk aversion coefficient. Because utility increases with risk and return, the indifference curve for a risk‐averse investor has a negative slope.",B,"Let's consider each statement separately. Statement 1 says that a portfolio on the minimum variance frontier may have a positive or negative weight on the risk‐free asset. The minimum variance frontier represents the set of portfolios that provide the lowest possible risk for a given level of expected return. A risk-free asset, by definition, has zero risk. Therefore, it would not make sense to have a negative weight on a risk-free asset in a minimum variance portfolio because that would increase the portfolio's risk. So, Statement 1 is incorrect. - Statement 2 says that an investor with a negative risk-aversion coefficient would have an indifference curve with a negative slope. Risk aversion is a measure of an investor's willingness to take on risk. A negative risk-aversion coefficient would imply that the investor prefers more risk to less, which is not typical but theoretically possible. In this case, the investor's indifference curve, which represents combinations of risk and return that the investor finds equally desirable, would indeed have a negative slope because the investor would be willing to accept more risk for less return. So, Statement 2 is correct. - Therefore, the most likely answer is that Statement 2 is correct and Statement 1 is incorrect.",yes
The correlation between two assets equals –0.296 and the covariance between the two assets is –0.0104.

We can rearrange the formula to solve for the product of the standard deviations: StdDev1 * StdDev2 = Covariance / Correlation. - Substituting the given values into the formula, we get: StdDev1 * StdDev2 = -0.0104 / -0.296 = 0.035135135. - Now, we need to find the pair of standard deviations that, when multiplied together, would give a product closest to 0.035135135.

The correlation of an asset with the variance of the market.,B, Beta equals the covariance of an asset with the market as a proportion of the market’s covariance with itself. The market’s covariance with itself basically equals the market’s variance.,B,"Beta is a measure of the systematic risk of a security or a portfolio in comparison to the market as a whole. It is used in the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), which calculates the expected return of an asset based on its beta and expected market returns. - Beta is also known as the beta coefficient. - In other words, beta represents the tendency of a security's returns to respond to swings in the market. A beta of 1 indicates that the security's price will move with the market. A beta less than 1 indicates the security will be less volatile than the market. A beta greater than 1 indicates the security's price will be more volatile than the market.",yes
Portfolio A has a higher total risk but lower total return than the market portfolio. Which of the following is least likely?,A. Portfolio A has a beta that is lower than 1.,B. Portfolio A has relatively high unsystematic risk.,C. Portfolio A cannot possibly lie on the SML.,C," The portfolio can lie on the SML if most of its total risk is unsystematic risk that can be diversified away. To plot on the SML, the portfolio must have a beta of less than 1, as its expected return is lower than that of the market portfolio.",C,"The question is asking which scenario is least likely given that Portfolio A has a higher total risk but lower total return than the market portfolio. - Option A: Portfolio A has a higher standard deviation than the market portfolio. This is likely because standard deviation is a measure of total risk, and we know that Portfolio A has a higher total risk than the market portfolio. - Option B: Portfolio A has a lower beta than the market portfolio. This could be possible because beta measures systematic risk, not total risk. It's possible for a portfolio to have a high total risk (due to high unsystematic risk) but a low beta if its returns are not very correlated with the market. - Option C: Portfolio A has a higher Sharpe ratio than the market portfolio. This is least likely because the Sharpe ratio is a measure of risk-adjusted return. Given that Portfolio A has a higher total risk but lower total return than the market portfolio, it would be unlikely for it to have a higher Sharpe ratio than the market portfolio.",yes

Which of the following is most likely?",A. Only Statement 2 is incorrect.,B. Both statements are correct.,C. Both statements are incorrect.,A, ETFs generally have a tax advantage over mutual funds.,A,"Let's consider each statement separately. Statement 1 says that unlike mutual funds, hedge funds do not face heavy disclosure requirements. This is true. Hedge funds are less regulated than mutual funds and are not required to disclose as much information to the public. They are typically only available to accredited investors, who are assumed to be more sophisticated and able to handle the risks associated with less transparency. - Statement 2 says that mutual funds generally have a tax advantage over ETFs. This is not necessarily true. Both mutual funds and ETFs have their own tax implications. However, ETFs are often seen as more tax efficient than mutual funds because they have a unique structure that allows investors to avoid triggering capital gains taxes when they buy and sell shares. In a mutual fund, the fund manager's buying and selling of securities within the fund can trigger capital gains taxes for the fund's shareholders, even if those shareholders didn't sell their own shares. - So, Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is false.",yes

The HPY is calculated as (P1 - P0) / P0, where P1 is the price at the end of the holding period and P0 is the price at the beginning of the holding period. In this case, the T-bill is purchased for $940 and the money market yield is 6.2%. The money market yield is calculated as (Discount / Face Value) * (360 / Days to Maturity). We can rearrange this formula to solve for the face value, which will be the price at the end of the holding period. The face value is therefore $940 / (1 - (0.062 * (120 / 360))) = $1000. The HPY is therefore ($1000 - $940) / $940 = 0.06383 or 6.383%. - The second step is to calculate the Effective Annual Yield (EAY). The EAY is calculated as (1 + HPY)^(365 / Days to Maturity) - 1. In this case, the HPY is 0.06383 and there are 120 days left to maturity. The EAY is therefore (1 + 0.06383)^(365 / 120) - 1 = 0.2683 or 26.83%.",no

"Consider the following statements: Statement 1: All inferior goods are Giffen goods, but not all Giffen goods are inferior goods. Statement 2: Veblen goods and Giffen goods both have upward‐sloping demand curves. Which of the following is most likely?",A. Both statements are correct.,B. Only one statement is correct.,C. Both statements are incorrect.,B," Statement 1 is incorrect. All Giffen goods are inferior goods (as the income effect of a price reduction is negative), but not all inferior goods are Giffen goods (as the income effect for inferior goods does not necessarily outweigh the substitution effect). Statement 2 is correct. Both Veblen goods and Giffen goods exhibit a positive relationship between own‐price and quantity demanded.",B,"First, let's understand the definitions of the terms used in the statements. Inferior goods are goods for which demand decreases when consumer income increases. Giffen goods are a type of inferior goods where demand increases even as the price increases, which contradicts the law of demand. Veblen goods are goods for which demand increases as the price increases, because of their exclusivity and appeal as status symbols. - Looking at Statement 1, it says that all inferior goods are Giffen goods. This is incorrect. While Giffen goods are a type of inferior goods, not all inferior goods are Giffen goods. Giffen goods are a rare exception and not the norm. - Statement 2 says that Veblen goods and Giffen goods both have upward‐sloping demand curves. This is correct. Both Veblen and Giffen goods defy the typical law of demand. For Veblen goods, higher prices make them more desirable as status symbols. For Giffen goods, a price increase leads consumers to consume more of the good, typically because they can't afford to replace it with more expensive substitutes. - So, Statement 1 is incorrect and Statement 2 is correct.",yes

In Schumpeter's vision of capitalism, innovative entry by entrepreneurs was the disruptive force that sustained economic growth, even as it destroyed the value of established companies and laborers that enjoyed some degree of monopoly power derived from previous technological, organizational, regulatory, and economic paradigms. - So, the concept of 'creative destruction' asserts that economic growth is driven by innovation and change, which often leads to the destruction of old industries and the creation of new ones.",no
In which of the following types of price discrimination does the monopolist use the quantity purchased by a consumer to determine how much she values the product?,A. First-degree price discrimination,B. Second-degree price discrimination,C. Third-degree price discrimination,B," • In first degree price discrimination, the monopolist charges each consumer the highest price she is willing and able to pay. • In second‐degree price discrimination, the monopolist offers a variety of quantity‐based pricing options that induce customers to self‐select based on how highly they value the product (e.g., volume discounts, product bundling). • Third‐degree price discrimination can occur when customers can be separated by geographical or other traits. One set of customers is charged a higher price while the other is charged a lower price (e.g., airlines charge higher fares on one-day, round‐trip tickets, as they are more likely to be purchased by businesspeople).",B,"Price discrimination is a pricing strategy where identical or largely similar goods or services are transacted at different prices by the same provider in different markets or segments. There are three types of price discrimination: first-degree, second-degree, and third-degree. - First-degree price discrimination, also known as perfect price discrimination, is when a monopolist charges each consumer his or her maximum willingness to pay. The monopolist captures all consumer surplus and converts it into producer surplus. - Second-degree price discrimination, also known as quantity discrimination, is when price varies according to quantity demanded. Larger quantities are available at a lower unit price. This is the type of price discrimination that uses the quantity purchased by a consumer to determine how much she values the product. - Third-degree price discrimination is when price varies by customer type. Different consumer groups are charged different prices for the same product or service.",yes
A firm in perfect competition will continue to operate in the short run as long as:,A. Price exceeds average total cost.,B. Price exceeds average variable cost.,C. Price exceeds average fixed cost.,B," In the short run, a firm in perfect competition will continue to produce as long as price exceeds AVC, as this would mean that it is covering at least a portion of its fixed costs.",A,"The question is asking under what conditions a firm in perfect competition will continue to operate in the short run. In perfect competition, firms are price takers and cannot influence the market price. They will continue to produce as long as they are covering their variable costs. This is because, in the short run, fixed costs are sunk and cannot be recovered. Therefore, even if the firm is not covering its total costs (fixed + variable), it will continue to operate as long as it is covering its variable costs. If it is not even covering its variable costs, it would be better off shutting down and avoiding those costs.",no
Which of the following most likely represents the effects of an increase in the price level? IS Curve LM Curve AD Curve,A. Unchanged Shifts to the left Unchanged,B. Shifts to the left Unchanged Shifts to the left,C. Unchanged Shifts to the left Shifts to the right,A," • A change in prices has no impact on the IS curve. • An increase in the price level decreases real money supply, so income has to fall so that real money demand also falls and keeps the money market in equilibrium. Therefore, the LM curve shifts to the left. • There is a movement along the AD curve (no shift).",B,"First, let's understand what each curve represents. The IS curve represents the relationship between the interest rate and the level of income in the goods market. The LM curve represents the relationship between the interest rate and the level of income in the money market. The AD curve represents the total demand for goods and services in an economy at different price levels. - An increase in the price level would mean that the purchasing power of money decreases. This would lead to a decrease in real money balances, which would shift the LM curve upwards or to the left, indicating a higher interest rate for a given level of income. - An increase in the price level would not directly affect the IS curve, as it is determined by factors such as investment and government spending, which are not directly affected by changes in the price level. - Finally, an increase in the price level would shift the AD curve to the left, as the higher price level would decrease the quantity of goods and services demanded. - So, an increase in the price level would most likely cause the LM curve to shift upwards or to the left, and the AD curve to shift to the left, but would not directly affect the IS curve.",no
Which of the following most likely represents the causes of an increase in aggregate demand? Taxes Bank Reserves Indirect Exchange Rate,A. Decrease Increase Decrease,B. Decrease Decrease Increase,C. Increase Increase Decrease,A," • A decrease in taxes increases disposable income and consumption. • An increase in bank reserves increases money supply, reduces interest rates, and increases consumption and investment. • A decrease (depreciation) in the indirect exchange rate (FC/DC) results in higher exports and lower imports.",C,"First, let's understand what aggregate demand is. Aggregate demand is the total demand for all goods and services in an economy. It's influenced by several factors, including consumer spending, investment spending, government spending, and net exports. - Next, let's consider each of the options individually. - Taxes: An increase in taxes would generally decrease aggregate demand, as it reduces consumers' disposable income and thus their ability to purchase goods and services. So, this option is unlikely. - Bank Reserves: Bank reserves are the minimum amounts that banks are required to hold in cash. An increase in bank reserves could potentially decrease the money supply, which could in turn decrease aggregate demand. So, this option is also unlikely. - Indirect Exchange Rate: The indirect exchange rate is the amount of foreign currency that can be exchanged for one unit of domestic currency. If the indirect exchange rate increases, it means that the domestic currency is depreciating. This could increase aggregate demand by making domestic goods and services cheaper for foreign buyers, thus increasing net exports. - So, based on this analysis, the most likely cause of an increase in aggregate demand among the options given is an increase in the indirect exchange rate.",no
A situation in which injections of money into the economy fail to reduce interest rates or influence real economy activity is known as:,A. Money neutrality.,B. Liquidity trap.,C. Quantitative easing.,B," • Money neutrality states that money supply and/or the money growth rate will not affect the real interest rate, but will influence inflationary expectations. • Quantitative easing is basically an expansionary open market operation conducted on a much larger scale in the hope of stimulating the economy. • A liquidity trap is a situation where an interest rate cut (to counter deflation in the economy) fails to lower savings and stimulate consumption.",A,"This question is asking about a specific economic situation where monetary injections fail to stimulate the economy or reduce interest rates. This is a concept in macroeconomics. - There are several economic theories that could potentially fit this description, but the most likely one is the liquidity trap. - A liquidity trap is a situation where monetary policy becomes ineffective because the nominal interest rate is close to or equal to zero. In such a situation, people prefer to hold cash rather than investing or spending, which makes monetary injections ineffective at stimulating economic activity or reducing interest rates.",no

Which of the following models of international trade asserts that differences in factor endowments are the primary source of comparative advantage?,A. Ricardian model,B. Heckscher‐Ohlin model,C. Fischer model,B, • The Ricardian model asserts that differences in technology are the key source of comparative advantage. • The Heckscher‐Ohlin model asserts that differences in factor endowments are the primary source of comparative advantage. • The Fisher effect is directly related to the concept of money neutrality. It states that the real rate of interest in an economy is stable over time so that changes in nominal interest rates are the result of changes in expected inflation.,B,"The question is asking about a model of international trade that asserts that differences in factor endowments are the primary source of comparative advantage. Factor endowments refer to the amount of labor, land, capital, and entrepreneurship that a country possesses and can exploit for manufacturing. Three models of international trade are commonly discussed: the Ricardian model, the Heckscher-Ohlin model, and the Leontief Paradox. - The Ricardian model of international trade suggests that countries specialize in producing goods for which they have a comparative advantage, and it is based on technological differences between countries. Therefore, it does not primarily focus on factor endowments. - The Leontief Paradox is a finding in international trade that contradicts the Heckscher-Ohlin theory. It found that the U.S., the most capital-rich country, exports labor-intensive commodities and imports capital-intensive commodities. Therefore, it is not a model that asserts that differences in factor endowments are the primary source of comparative advantage. - The Heckscher-Ohlin model, on the other hand, asserts that a country will export goods that use its abundant factors intensively, and import goods that use its scarce factors intensively. Therefore, it is based on differences in factor endowments between countries.",yes

A trader is quoted the following exchange rates: Spot Rate Expected Spot Rate in One Year USD:JPY 77.68 77.50 GBP:USD 1.5682 1.5548 EUR:USD 1.3754 1.3644 Which of the following correctly lists the currencies from strongest to weakest based on their performance over the next year?,"A. JPY, USD, GBP, EUR","B. USD, JPY, EUR, GBP","C. JPY, USD, EUR, GBP",C," Based on the information given, the EUR:USD exchange rate is expected to decline from 1.3754 to 1.3644. This means that EUR is expected to depreciate versus USD. Further, the GBP:USD exchange rate is expected to decline from 1.5682 to 1.5548. This means that GBP is also expected to depreciate versus USD. Therefore, we can say that USD is expected to strengthen against both EUR and GBP. In order to determine which currency is stronger between EUR and GBP, we will need to calculate the spot EUR:GBP cross‐rate as well as the expected EUR‐GBP cross‐rate in one year. Current EUR‐GBP spot rate = 1.3754 × (1.5682) –1 = 0.8771 Expected EUR‐GBP spot rate in one year = 1.3644 × (1.5548)–1 = 0.8775 The EUR:GBP exchange rate is expected to increase from 0.8771 to 0.8775. This means that EUR is expected to appreciate against GBP. The USD:JPY exchange rate is expected to decline from 77.68 to 77.50, which means that USD is expected to depreciate against JPY. Therefore, the list of currencies from strongest to weakest based on their performance over the next year is: JPY, USD, EUR, GBP",B,"The question is asking us to rank the currencies from strongest to weakest based on their expected performance over the next year. To do this, we need to compare the current spot rate with the expected spot rate in one year for each currency pair.

Conversely, if the expected spot rate is higher than the current spot rate, it means that the first currency in the pair is expected to strengthen relative to the second currency. - For USD:JPY, the current spot rate is 77.68 and the expected spot rate in one year is 77.50. This means that the USD is expected to weaken relative to the JPY. - For GBP:USD, the current spot rate is 1.5682 and the expected spot rate in one year is 1.5548. This means that the GBP is expected to weaken relative to the USD. - For EUR:USD, the current spot rate is 1.3754 and the expected spot rate in one year is 1.3644. This means that the EUR is expected to weaken relative to the USD. - Based on these observations, the JPY is expected to strengthen relative to the USD, and the USD is expected to strengthen relative to both the GBP and the EUR. Therefore, the ranking from strongest to weakest is JPY, USD, GBP, EUR.",no
The quality bias that arises when a Laspeyres index is used to calculate inflation can most likely be mitigated by:,A. Using hedonic pricing.,B. Introducing new products in the basket more regularly.,C. Using a Fischer index.,A, • Hedonic pricing refers to the practice of adjusting prices for quality improvements. • The substitution bias can be mitigated by using chained price index formulas like the Fischer index. • Introducing new products into the basket more regularly deals with the new product bias. Questions 45–68 relate to Financial Reporting and Analysis Assume IFRS unless otherwise stated.,B,"A Laspeyres index is a price index that is computed by taking the ratio of the total cost of a specified group of commodities at current prices to the total cost of the same group of commodities at base-period prices, and then multiplying by 100. The base period is a period of time used as a reference point for comparison with other periods. The Laspeyres index tends to overstate inflation because it does not account for substitution effects. When the price of a good increases, consumers tend to substitute that good with a cheaper alternative. However, the Laspeyres index assumes that the quantity of goods consumed remains constant over time. - To mitigate the quality bias in a Laspeyres index, we could use a different type of price index that accounts for changes in the quality of goods and services over time. This could be a Paasche index, which uses current-period quantities, or a Fisher index, which is a geometric mean of the Laspeyres and Paasche indices. Both of these indices account for changes in consumption patterns over time, which can help to mitigate the quality bias in a Laspeyres index. - Another way to mitigate the quality bias in a Laspeyres index is to adjust the prices of goods and services for changes in quality. This can be done using hedonic regression, which is a method of estimating the demand or value of a good or service by breaking it down into its constituent characteristics and estimating the contributory value of each characteristic. This method can help to account for changes in the quality of goods and services over time, which can help to mitigate the quality bias in a Laspeyres index.",no

Profit recognized during 2009 = 4m / 10m × (10m − 3m) = $2.8m Under the cost recovery method, profits are only recognized once total cash received exceeds total cost. Profit recognized during 2009 = 4m − 3m = $1m",B,"First, let's understand the two methods mentioned in the question: the Installment Method and the Cost Recovery Method. - The Installment Method recognizes profit at the time of collection. This means that the profit is recognized proportionally to the cash received. In this case, Quintus received $4,000,000 in 2009 out of the total $10,000,000. So, the profit recognized would be the proportion of cash received multiplied by the total profit. The total profit is the selling price minus the cost, which is $10,000,000 - $3,000,000 = $7,000,000. So, the profit recognized in 2009 would be ($4,000,000 / $10,000,000) * $7,000,000. - The Cost Recovery Method, on the other hand, recognizes profit only after all costs have been recovered. This means that no profit is recognized until the cash collections exceed the cost of the land. In this case, the cost of the land is $3,000,000 and Quintus received $4,000,000 in 2009. So, the profit recognized in 2009 would be the cash received minus the cost, which is $4,000,000 - $3,000,000.",yes

There has only been an impairment of long‐lived assets over the year.,A," The increase in gross fixed assets (historical cost) over the year indicates that the company has purchased long‐lived assets during the year. Note that U.S. GAAP does not allow revaluation of fixed assets. Despite the asset acquisition, if accumulated depreciation has fallen over the year, the company has sold a long‐lived asset as well.",B,"The question is asking us to determine the most likely scenario given that a company's gross fixed assets increased and its accumulated depreciation decreased from the previous year to the current year under U.S. GAAP. - Gross fixed assets represent the total cost of all fixed assets (like property, plant, and equipment) before accounting for any depreciation. If this number increased, it means the company has acquired more fixed assets. - Accumulated depreciation is the total depreciation that has been charged to expense since the acquisition of the fixed assets. It is subtracted from the cost of the fixed assets to arrive at their book value. If accumulated depreciation decreased, it means less depreciation expense was recognized this year compared to the previous year. - This could happen in two scenarios: either the company disposed of some of its older, fully depreciated assets, or it revised its estimate of the useful life or salvage value of its assets, resulting in lower depreciation expense. - Without more information, we cannot determine which of these scenarios is more likely. However, the question does not provide any options related to the disposal of assets, so we can rule that out. - The only option that fits the information given in the question is that the company revised its estimate of the useful life or salvage value of its assets, resulting in lower depreciation expense.",no

Because replacement cost is greater than NRV, adjusted replacement cost (market) equals NRV, and the company will record its inventory at NRV.",C,"The question is asking about the value of inventory recognized under IFRS and U.S. GAAP when the net realizable value of a unit of a company’s inventory is lower than its replacement cost, and the replacement cost equals its original cost. - Under IFRS, inventory is measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. If the net realizable value is lower than the cost, then the inventory is written down to its net realizable value. - Under U.S. GAAP, inventory is measured at the lower of cost or market, where market is defined as current replacement cost. However, the market value cannot be more than the net realizable value and cannot be less than the net realizable value less a normal profit margin. If the replacement cost (which equals the original cost in this case) is higher than the net realizable value, then the inventory is written down to the market value, which in this case would be the net realizable value. - Therefore, under both IFRS and U.S. GAAP, the inventory would be recognized at its net realizable value.",no

This means that the COGS will be higher under LIFO compared to other inventory valuation methods like FIFO (First-In, First-Out). - Higher COGS will result in lower gross profit and, consequently, lower taxable income. Therefore, the use of LIFO in a period of rising prices will most likely result in lower taxes. - Stable inventory quantities mean that there is no significant change in the number of items in inventory.

The tax base of a liability is the amount that will be deductible for tax purposes in the future when the liability is settled. The carrying value is the amount at which an asset or liability is valued according to the accounting principles. If the tax base of a liability is greater than its carrying value, it means that the company will have a future tax benefit, because it will be able to deduct more than the liability's carrying value. This future tax benefit is a deferred tax asset. So, Statement 1 is correct. - Next, let's consider Statement 2: 'Permanent differences result in a difference between the company’s statutory and effective tax rate.' Permanent differences are differences between the tax and financial reporting of revenue or expense items that will not reverse in the future.

Which of the following is most likely when a temporary difference gives rise to a deferred tax liability?,A. Higher expenses are recognized on the financial statements than on the tax return.,B. A liability’s tax base is lower than its carrying value.,C. Taxable income is lower than accounting profit.,C, A temporary difference gives rise to a deferred tax liability when: • Lower expenses are recognized on the financial statements than on the tax return. • A liability’s tax base is greater than its carrying value. • Taxable income is lower than accounting profit.,C,"A deferred tax liability arises when a company's tax expense on its income statement is less than the tax payment it owes to the tax authorities. This usually happens due to differences in the timing of income recognition between tax accounting (IRS rules) and financial accounting (GAAP or IFRS rules). - A temporary difference is a difference between the tax base of an asset or liability and its carrying amount in the balance sheet that will result in taxable amounts in future periods when the carrying amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled. - Therefore, a temporary difference gives rise to a deferred tax liability when the company expects to pay more taxes in the future due to the reversal of this difference. This could be due to reasons such as accelerated depreciation for tax purposes (which reduces tax expense now but increases it in the future) or revenue recognized now for financial reporting purposes but taxed later.",yes
"Assume U.S. GAAP applies. Compared to a scenario in which it issued bonds at par, a company that issued bonds at a discount will least likely:",A. Report higher interest expense each year during the bond’s term.,B. Report an increasing book value of the liability each year.,C. Report lower cash flow from operations.,C," Compared to a scenario in which it issues bonds at par, a company that issues bonds at a discount will record: • Lower financing cash inflows at issuance. • Higher interest expense every year during the term of the bonds. • Identical financing cash outflows at maturity (par value). • Identical operating cash outflows each year (coupon payment).",C,"First, let's understand what it means for a company to issue bonds at a discount. This means that the company is selling its bonds for less than their face value. This typically happens when the interest rate that the company is offering on its bonds is lower than the current market interest rate. - Now, let's consider the three scenarios: A) have a higher interest expense, B) report lower net income, and C) have a higher debt to equity ratio. - A) Under U.S. GAAP, when a company issues bonds at a discount, the discount is amortized over the life of the bond, which increases the interest expense. So, it's likely that the company will have a higher interest expense. - B) Higher interest expense reduces the net income. So, it's also likely that the company will report lower net income. - C) The debt to equity ratio is calculated by dividing total debt by total equity. Issuing bonds, whether at par or at a discount, increases the company's total debt. However, issuing bonds at a discount doesn't necessarily affect the company's total equity. Therefore, it's least likely that the company will have a higher debt to equity ratio.",yes
Recognition of a lease as a finance lease as opposed to an operating lease by the lessee will most likely result in a higher:,A. Debt‐to‐assets ratio.,B. Return on assets.,C. Current ratio.,A," • Under a finance lease, the lessee recognizes an asset and an equal‐in‐value liability on its books at inception of the lease. The percentage increase in debt is greater than the percentage increase in assets (for any company debt < assets). Therefore, the numerator effect dominates and the ratio increases upon recognition of a finance lease. • Because assets increase upon recognition of a finance lease, ROA falls. • Because current liabilities also increase upon recognition of a finance lease (current portion of lease obligation), the current ratio falls.",B,"First, let's understand the difference between a finance lease and an operating lease. A finance lease is a lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset to the lessee. An operating lease is a lease other than a finance lease. - In terms of financial reporting, a finance lease is capitalized on the balance sheet, which means the asset and corresponding liability are recorded. This results in higher total assets and total liabilities compared to an operating lease, which is not capitalized and is treated more like a rental agreement. - Next, let's consider the impact on the income statement. Lease payments under a finance lease are split into interest expense and principal repayment. The interest portion is an expense that reduces net income. In the early years of a finance lease, the interest expense is typically higher than the straight-line lease expense recognized under an operating lease. Therefore, a finance lease will most likely result in higher interest expense. - Finally, let's consider the impact on the cash flow statement. Under a finance lease, the principal portion of lease payments is reported in the cash flows from financing activities, while the interest portion is reported in the cash flows from operating activities. Under an operating lease, all lease payments are reported in the cash flows from operating activities. Therefore, a finance lease will most likely result in higher cash outflows from financing activities.",no
"In order to inflate current-period earnings, a company would least likely:",A. Increase the useful life of depreciable assets.,B. Increase estimates of uncollectible accounts receivable.,C. Capitalize a cost rather than expense it.,B, • Increasing the useful life of depreciable assets would lower depreciation expense and increase net income. • Increasing the estimated amount for the uncollectible amount would decrease net income. Capitalizing a cost rather than expensing it would increase net income.,A,"This question is asking which action a company would least likely take if it wanted to inflate its current-period earnings. Inflating earnings typically involves manipulating financial statements to make a company's financial performance appear better than it actually is. This can be done in a number of ways, such as recognizing revenue prematurely, delaying the recognition of expenses, or manipulating the company's reserves. However, the question is asking for the action that a company would least likely take, so I need to think about which of the options would not help to inflate earnings.",no

In this case, the company has issued a semi-annual coupon bond, so the interest payments are made twice a year. The cost of debt is calculated as the bond's yield to maturity (YTM). - The YTM is the discount rate that makes the present value of a bond's future cash flows equal to its current market price. The cash flows of a bond consist of the semi-annual coupon payments and the par value at maturity. - The formula to calculate YTM is complex and usually requires a financial calculator or software. However, given that the bond's current market value is slightly above its par value, we can infer that the YTM is slightly below the coupon rate. - The coupon rate is 9% per annum, but since payments are made semi-annually, the effective annual rate (EAR) is slightly higher than 9%. However, since the YTM is slightly below the coupon rate, we can estimate that the YTM is close to 9% per annum. - Finally, the after-tax cost of debt is calculated by multiplying the cost of debt (YTM) by (1 - tax rate).

It's the equivalent annual interest rate the company would have to pay if it borrowed the money instead. - To calculate the cost of trade credit, we can use the formula: Cost of Trade Credit = Discount / (1 - Discount) * (365 / (Full Payment Day - Discount Period)). - In this case, the discount is 1% or 0.01, the full payment day is 40 days, and the discount period is 30 days. - So, the cost of trade credit is: 0.01 / (1 - 0.01) * (365 / (40 - 30)) = 0.01 / 0.99 * 36.5 = 0.3697 or 36.97%.",yes

Statement 1 says that a stop-loss buy order is placed above the current market price. A stop-loss buy order is indeed placed above the current market price. This is because a stop-loss buy order is designed to limit an investor's loss or lock in a profit on a security that they have sold short. The order is placed above the current market price because it is triggered when the market price rises to the stop price. So, Statement 1 is correct. - Statement 2 says that a marketable limit sell order is placed below the best bid. A marketable limit sell order is an order to sell a security at a specific price or better. However, this order is placed above the current market price, not below. This is because the seller wants to sell the security at a price that is higher than the current market price. So, Statement 2 is incorrect. - Based on the analysis of the two statements, the most likely answer is that Statement 1 is correct and Statement 2 is incorrect.",yes
Which of the following industries is least likely to be very concentrated on a global scale?,A. Oil services,B. Branded pharmaceuticals,C.

Service arms of national oil companies may control significant market share in their own countries.",C,"When we talk about an industry being concentrated, we mean that a small number of firms hold a large market share. Industries that are concentrated often have high barriers to entry, such as high capital requirements, or are dominated by a few large companies that have significant market power. - Now, let's consider the options: A) Pharmaceuticals, B) Technology, C) Retail. - A) Pharmaceuticals: This industry is known to be highly concentrated. It requires significant investment in research and development, and the process of getting a drug approved can be lengthy and expensive. This creates high barriers to entry and results in a small number of large companies dominating the market. - B) Technology: This industry can also be highly concentrated, especially in areas like social media or search engines, where network effects create a 'winner-takes-all' dynamic. However, there are also areas of the tech industry that are less concentrated, such as software development, where there are many small and medium-sized firms. - C) Retail: This industry tends to be less concentrated on a global scale. While there are certainly large multinational retail corporations, there are also many small and medium-sized retailers. The barriers to entry in retail are generally lower than in pharmaceuticals or technology, and there is often more competition at a local level.",no
Which of the following types of indices most likely requires frequent rebalancing?,A. Equal weighted,B. Market cap weighted,C. Price weighted,A, Equal weighted indices must be rebalanced whenever the relative prices of constituent securities change.,A,"An index is a statistical measure that represents the value of a group of financial assets. There are different types of indices, and they can be classified based on different criteria, such as the weighting method used, the type of assets included, or the geographical area covered. - Rebalancing is the process of realigning the weightings of a portfolio of assets. Rebalancing involves periodically buying or selling assets in a portfolio to maintain an original or desired level of asset allocation or risk. - Indices that require frequent rebalancing are those that have a high level of turnover, meaning that the composition of the index changes frequently. This could be due to various factors, such as changes in the market capitalization of the companies included in the index, changes in the prices of the assets, or changes in the economic conditions that affect the performance of the assets. - Among the different types of indices, equal-weighted indices, price-weighted indices, and market capitalization-weighted indices, the one that most likely requires frequent rebalancing is the equal-weighted index. - An equal-weighted index assigns the same weight to all assets in the index, regardless of their market capitalization. Therefore, any change in the price of any asset will affect the overall value of the index, and to maintain the equal weighting, the index will need to be rebalanced frequently. - On the other hand, a price-weighted index gives more weight to assets with higher prices, and a market capitalization-weighted index gives more weight to assets with larger market capitalizations. These types of indices do not need to be rebalanced as frequently, because changes in the prices or market capitalizations of the assets do not affect the overall value of the index as much.",yes
Consider the following statements: Statement 1: The momentum anomaly goes against weak form EMH. Statement 2: The size effect anomaly goes against weak form EMH. Which of the following is most likely?,A. Both statements are correct.,B. Both statements are incorrect.,C. Only Statement 1 is correct.,C, The momentum anomaly asserts that investors can earn abnormal returns by purchasing stocks that have performed well in the recent past. The size effect anomaly asserts that investors can outperform on a risk‐adjusted basis by simply purchasing smaller companies.,A,"First, let's understand what the weak form Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) is. The weak form EMH asserts that stock prices already reflect all past trading information and that past returns do not affect future returns. In other words, it is impossible to achieve above-average returns through technical analysis. - Next, let's consider the momentum anomaly. This is a situation where stocks which have performed well in the past continue to perform well in the future, and vice versa. This goes against the weak form EMH, which states that past returns do not affect future returns. Therefore, Statement 1 is correct. - Finally, let's consider the size effect anomaly. This is a situation where smaller firms, on average, have higher risk-adjusted returns than larger firms. This anomaly does not contradict the weak form EMH, because it does not involve using past price data to predict future returns. Therefore, Statement 2 is incorrect.",no

"An analyst gathered the following information about a company: Next year’s dividend = $3.75 Risk‐free rate of return = 5% Market risk premium = 8% Beta of company’s common stock = 1.1 If the analyst estimates that the selling price of the company’s stock after one year will be $43, the value of the company’s common stock today is closest to:",A. $41.,B. $42.,C. $43.,A, Use the one‐period DDM. Cost of equity = 0.05 + 1.1 (0.08) = 13.8% Stock’s value = (3.75 / 1.138) + (43 / 1.138) = $41.08,B,"The question is asking for the value of the company's common stock today. This can be calculated using the Gordon Growth Model, which is a model used to determine the intrinsic value of a stock, based on a future series of dividends that grow at a constant rate. However, in this case, we are given a specific dividend for next year and a selling price for the stock after one year, so we will use the Dividend Discount Model (DDM) instead. - The DDM is a method of valuing a company's stock by using predicted dividends and discounting them back to present value. The formula is P0 = D1 / (k - g), where P0 is the price of the stock today, D1 is the dividend expected next year, k is the required rate of return, and g is the growth rate of dividends. However, since we are not given a growth rate, we will modify the formula to P0 = D1 / k + P1 / (1 + k), where P1 is the selling price of the stock after one year. - First, we need to calculate the required rate of return (k). This can be done using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), which is a model that describes the relationship between systematic risk and expected return for assets. The formula is k = Rf + Beta * (Rm - Rf), where Rf is the risk-free rate, Beta is the beta of the stock, and Rm is the market return. The market return can be calculated as Rf + Market risk premium, which is 5% + 8% = 13%. - Substituting the given values into the CAPM formula, we get k = 5% + 1.1 * (13% - 5%) = 5% + 1.1 * 8% = 5% + 8.8% = 13.8%. - Next, we substitute the values into the modified DDM formula. We get P0 = $3.75 / 13.8% + $43 / (1 + 13.8%) = $27.17 + $37.77 = $64.94. - So, the value of the company's common stock today is closest to $64.94.",no

This is a dividend discount model (DDM) problem, but with a twist. The company will not pay any dividends for the next four years, so we need to calculate the value of the stock at the end of Year 4 and then discount it back to the present. - The dividend in Year 5 will be the payout ratio times the EPS in Year 5. The EPS in Year 5 is the EPS in Year 4 grown by 7%. So, the dividend in Year 5 is 0.45 * ($4.50 * 1.07) = $2.17. - The value of the stock at the end of Year 4 is the dividend in Year 5 divided by the difference between the cost of equity and the growth rate. So, the value of the stock at the end of Year 4 is $2.17 / (0.12 - 0.07) = $43.40. - Finally, we need to discount this value back to the present. The present value of the stock is the value at the end of Year 4 divided by (1 + cost of equity) raised to the power of 4. So, the present value of the stock is $43.40 / (1.12^4) = $30.91.",no

Only Statement 2 is correct.,C," • Sinking fund provisions reduce credit risk, as investors receive interest and principal repayments during the term of the bonds. • Sinking funds increase reinvestment risk, as interest and principal repayments may have to be reinvested at lower rates if interest rates have fallen since the time of purchase.",B,"First, let's understand what a sinking fund arrangement is. A sinking fund is a fund established by a corporation or government agency for the purpose of reducing debt by repaying or purchasing outstanding loans and securities held against the entity. It provides a methodical way of repaying a debt. - Statement 1 suggests that sinking fund arrangements are not likely to reduce credit risk. This is incorrect. By setting aside money regularly to repay debt, a company reduces the risk that it will default on its obligations, which in turn reduces its credit risk. - Statement 2 suggests that sinking fund arrangements are not likely to reduce reinvestment risk.

Therefore, Statement 1 is likely incorrect. - Statement 2 suggests that the difference between spot rates and yields to maturity on coupon bonds is that spot rates have no element of reinvestment risk. This is true. Spot rates are single-period interest rates for zero-coupon bonds and do not have reinvestment risk, while yields to maturity on coupon bonds do have reinvestment risk because the coupon payments can be reinvested at different rates.

The yield on the putable bond must be lower than the yield on a bond with no embedded options to compensate the issuer for the option that it has sold to the investor.,C,"A putable bond is a bond with an embedded put option. The holder of the bond has the right, but not the obligation, to demand early repayment of the principal. The z-volatility spread is a measure of the credit risk of a bond. It is the spread over the risk-free rate that a bond needs to offer to compensate for the risk of default. - For a putable bond, the risk of default is lower than for a comparable non-putable bond. This is because the holder of the bond can demand repayment of the principal if the issuer's creditworthiness deteriorates. Therefore, the z-volatility spread for a putable bond should be lower than for a non-putable bond. - However, the z-volatility spread also includes a component for the risk of early repayment. For a putable bond, this risk is higher than for a non-putable bond, because the holder of the bond has the right to demand early repayment. Therefore, the z-volatility spread for a putable bond should be higher than for a non-putable bond. - In conclusion, the z-volatility spread for a putable bond will depend on the relative magnitudes of these two effects. If the reduction in default risk is larger than the increase in early repayment risk, the z-volatility spread will be lower for a putable bond. If the increase in early repayment risk is larger than the reduction in default risk, the z-volatility spread will be higher for a putable bond.",no

This is known as the bond's duration. Duration measures the percentage change in the price of a bond for a 1% change in yield. The higher the duration, the more sensitive the bond's price is to changes in yield. - In this case, the analyst has calculated that the bond's price would decrease by 13.5% if yields were to increase by 100 basis points (or 1%). This suggests that the bond has a high duration. - When yields decrease, bond prices increase. This is because the fixed coupon payments of the bond become more attractive compared to the lower yields available in the market. Therefore, if yields were to decrease by 100 basis points, we would expect the bond's price to increase. - However, the question is asking about the magnitude of the price increase. Because the bond has a high duration, we would expect the price increase to be significant. In fact, because duration is a linear approximation, we would expect the price increase to be roughly the same magnitude as the price decrease for an equivalent change in yield. - Therefore, if the bond's price would decrease by 13.5% for a 100 basis point increase in yield, we would expect the bond's price to increase by roughly 13.5% for a 100 basis point decrease in yield.",no

It's a useful measure for assessing interest rate risk. The formula for PVBP is: PVBP = (Price if yield decreases by 1 basis point - Price if yield increases by 1 basis point) / 2. - In this case, we need to calculate the price of the bond if the yield decreases by 1 basis point (i.e., from 4% to 3.99%) and if the yield increases by 1 basis point (i.e., from 4% to 4.01%). - To calculate the price of the bond, we can use the formula for the present value of a bond: Price = C * (1 - (1 + r)^-n) / r + FV / (1 + r)^n, where C is the annual coupon payment, r is the yield to maturity, n is the number of periods, and FV is the face value of the bond. - In this case, C = 5, r = 4% or 3.99% or 4.01%, n = 7, and FV = 100. So, we can calculate the price of the bond for each yield. - Then, we can substitute these prices into the formula for PVBP to find the price value of a basis point for this bond.",yes
"Consider the following statements: Statement 1: All other things remaining the same, a bond with higher convexity will outperform one with lower convexity in both bull and bear markets. Statement 2: Callable bonds exhibit negative convexity at low yields, but traditional fixed‐rate bonds and putable bonds exhibit positive convexity at all yield levels. Which of the following is most likely?",A. Only Statement 1 is correct.,B. Only Statement 2 is correct.,C. Both statements are correct.,C," The greater the convexity of a bond, the greater the price appreciation when yields decrease and the lower the price depreciation when yields increase. Callable bonds exhibit negative convexity at low yield levels. As it becomes increasingly likely that the issuer will exercise the embedded call option, the call price acts as a cap on the bond’s value and the slope of the price‐yield profile flattens (the rate of change of duration becomes negative). Traditional fixed‐rate bonds and putable bonds always have positive convexity.",C,"First, let's consider each statement separately. Statement 1 says that a bond with higher convexity will outperform one with lower convexity in both bull and bear markets, assuming all other factors remain the same. This is generally true because higher convexity means that the bond's price is more sensitive to changes in interest rates. Therefore, in a bull market where interest rates are falling, a bond with higher convexity will increase in price more than a bond with lower convexity. Similarly, in a bear market where interest rates are rising, a bond with higher convexity will decrease in price less than a bond with lower convexity. - Next, let's consider Statement 2. This statement says that callable bonds exhibit negative convexity at low yields, but traditional fixed-rate bonds and putable bonds exhibit positive convexity at all yield levels. This is also generally true. Callable bonds have negative convexity at low yields because the issuer has the right to call the bond back when interest rates fall, limiting the price appreciation potential of the bond. On the other hand, traditional fixed-rate bonds and putable bonds always exhibit positive convexity because their prices increase more when interest rates fall and decrease less when interest rates rise. - Based on this analysis, both Statement 1 and Statement 2 are correct.",yes

It is a type of investment yield that is calculated as the annual income (interest or dividends) divided by the current price of the security. - If the coupon rate is greater than the current yield, it means that the annual income from the bond is less than what the bondholder would receive if the bond were purchased at its face value.

A zero-coupon bond is a bond that does not pay interest but is sold at a discount to its face value. The investor will receive the face value of the bond at maturity. - Next, we need to understand what yield-to-maturity (YTM) is. YTM is the total return anticipated on a bond if it is held until it matures. YTM is expressed as an annual percentage rate (APR). - The formula to calculate YTM for a zero-coupon bond is: YTM = [(Face Value / Purchase Price) ^ (1 / Years to Maturity)] - 1 - Given that the face value is 100, the purchase price is 65, and the years to maturity is 5, we can substitute these values into the formula. - YTM = [(100 / 65) ^ (1 / 5)] - 1 - Calculating the above expression gives us the YTM as a decimal. To convert it to a percentage, we multiply by 100. - Finally, since the YTM is stated with a periodicity of 4, we need to multiply the annual YTM by 4 to get the periodic YTM.",no

Decrease the price of calls, but decrease the price of puts.",C. Increase the prices of both calls and puts.,C, An increase in volatility of the underlying increases the value of both calls and puts.,A,"Volatility is a measure of the uncertainty or risk associated with the size of changes in a security's value. It is typically measured by the standard deviation of the historical returns or average returns of a security. - An increase in volatility indicates that the price of the underlying security can change dramatically over a short time period in either direction. A higher volatility means that a security's value can potentially be spread out over a larger range of values. This means that the price of the security can change dramatically over a short time period in either direction. - In the context of options pricing, an increase in the volatility of the underlying asset increases the value of both call and put options. This is because higher volatility increases the likelihood that the option will be in-the-money at expiration, which increases the option's value. - Therefore, an increase in volatility of the underlying will most likely increase the value of an option.",no
Consider the following statements: Statement 1: There is never a reason to exercise an American call option early. Statement 2: There is never a reason to exercise an American put option early.

Only Statement 2 is incorrect.,C," • At times it may be beneficial to exercise an American option on a dividend-paying stock early. However, there is never a reason to exercise an American call option on a non- dividend-paying stock before expiration. • An American put option may be exercised early if the underlying company is in or nearing bankruptcy.",A,"First, let's understand what an American option is. An American option is a type of options contract that allows holders to exercise the option at any time before and including its expiration date. This is different from a European option, which can only be exercised at expiration. - Statement 1 suggests that there is never a reason to exercise an American call option early. This is generally true for non-dividend-paying stocks. The reason is that the value of an American call option is usually greater if it is held until expiration rather than exercised early. This is because the option's time value, which is the value of the possibility that the stock price might increase in the future, decreases as the option gets closer to its expiration date. Therefore, it is generally more profitable to sell the option than to exercise it early. - Statement 2 suggests that there is never a reason to exercise an American put option early. This is not necessarily true. An American put option can be exercised early if the investor believes that the stock price will increase before the option's expiration date. By exercising the put option early, the investor can sell the stock at the strike price, which is higher than the current market price. Therefore, there can be a reason to exercise an American put option early. - So, Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is false.",no

Effectively, it is providing insurance against credit risk to the protection buyer. • At expiration, all options are worth their exercise value.",B,"Let's consider each statement separately. Statement 1 says that in a credit default swap, the protection seller is betting that the reference entity will default. This is incorrect. In a credit default swap, the protection seller is actually betting that the reference entity will NOT default. The protection seller receives regular payments from the protection buyer and in return, agrees to compensate the buyer if the reference entity defaults. So, the protection seller is hoping that the reference entity remains solvent. - Statement 2 says that all other things remaining the same, an American option must have the same value as a European option at expiration. This is correct. An American option can be exercised at any time up to and including the expiration date, while a European option can only be exercised on the expiration date. However, at the expiration date, both options will have the same value because there is no longer any time value left in the options. The only value left is the intrinsic value, which is the same for both options. - So, the most likely answer is that Statement 1 is false and Statement 2 is true.",no

If the stock price rises above the exercise price, the option will be exercised, and the analyst will have to sell her stock for the exercise price of $88. In this case, her profit will be the exercise price minus the purchase price of the stock, plus the premium received for the call option. - Since we don't know the purchase price of the stock, we can't calculate the exact breakeven point. But we can say that it will be less than $88 (the exercise price), because the analyst received a premium for the call option. And it will be more than $81 ($88 - $7), because if the stock price is less than $81, the option won't be exercised and the analyst will lose money. - So the breakeven point is somewhere between $81 and $88.

This is not entirely accurate. While negative correlation can help in diversifying the portfolio and reducing risk, it's not the only factor that can improve the risk-return tradeoff. The expected return of the riskier asset also plays a crucial role. If the expected return is significantly high, it might justify the additional risk, even if the correlation is not negative. - Statement 2 suggests that a more risk-averse investor will have a steeper indifference curve than a less risk-averse investor. This is accurate. The indifference curve represents combinations of risk and return that the investor is indifferent to.
