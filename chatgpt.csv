Which of the following types of market indices has a contrarian effect on portfolio weights?,A. Fundamental weighting,B. Price weighting,C. Market value weighting,A, Fundamental weighting leads to a contrarian effect in that portfolio weights move away from securities whose prices have risen (as higher prices result in a lower earnings yield). Market value weighting results in the weight of a security in the index heading in the same direction as its price (momentum effect).,B,"To determine which type of market index has a contrarian effect on portfolio weights, we need to understand what a contrarian effect means. - A contrarian effect occurs when the weights of the assets in a portfolio move in the opposite direction of the market index. - There are three types of market indices: price-weighted, equal-weighted, and market-cap weighted. - In a price-weighted index, the weights of the assets are determined by their prices. As the prices of the assets increase, their weights in the index also increase. - In an equal-weighted index, all assets have equal weights regardless of their prices or market capitalizations. - In a market-cap weighted index, the weights of the assets are determined by their market capitalizations. As the market capitalizations of the assets increase, their weights in the index also increase. - Based on this information, it seems that an equal-weighted index would have a contrarian effect on portfolio weights. - If the prices or market capitalizations of the assets in an equal-weighted index increase, their weights in the index would remain the same. - Therefore, the correct answer is B.

Given that stated annual yield‐ to‐maturity is 6.5%, the flat price of the bond per 100 of par value on May 18, 2015 is closest to:",A. $101.7892.,B. $103.7054.,C. $104.0386.,A," Given the 30/360 day‐count convention, there are 118 days between the last coupon on January 20, 2015, and the settlement date on May 28, 2015 (10 days between January 20 and January 30, plus 90 days for the full months of February, March, and April, plus 18 days in May). Therefore, the fraction of the coupon period that has gone by equals 118/180. As of the last coupon payment date, there are 4.5 years (and nine semiannual periods) remaining until maturity. Using stated annual yield‐to‐maturity of 6.5%, or 3.25% per semiannual period, the price of the bond as of the last coupon payment date is calculated as: N = 9; PMT = –$3.50; FV = –$100; I/Y = 3.25%; CPT PV; PV = 101.924 The full price on May 18 is calculated as: PVFull = 101.924 × (1.0325)118/180 = $104.0836 The accrued interest is calculated as: AI = 118 / 180 × 3.50 = $2.2944 The flat price is calculated as: PV Flat = 104.0836 − 2.2944 = $101.7892",C,"To calculate the flat price of the bond, we need to calculate the present value of all the future cash flows. - First, let's calculate the coupon payments. - The bond has a 7% coupon rate and makes semiannual payments, so the coupon payment is 7% * (100/2) = $3.50. - Next, let's calculate the number of coupon payments remaining. - The bond matures on July 20, 2019, and the settlement date is May 18, 2015. - There are 4 years and 2 months remaining until maturity. - Since the bond makes semiannual payments, there are 4 * 2 = 8 coupon payments remaining. - Now, let's calculate the present value of the coupon payments. - The yield-to-maturity is 6.5%, which is the discount rate we will use. - Using the formula for the present value of an annuity, the present value of the coupon payments is $3.50 * (1 - (1 + 6.5%/2)^(-8))/(6.5%/2) = $25.84. - Finally, let's calculate the present value of the face value of the bond. - The face value of the bond is $100. - Using the yield-to-maturity of 6.5%, the present value of the face value is $100 * (1 + 6.5%/2)^(-8) = $74.73. - The flat price of the bond is the sum of the present value of the coupon payments and the present value of the face value. - Therefore, the flat price of the bond per 100 of par value on May 18, 2015 is $25.84 + $74.73 = $100.57.",no

Service arms of national oil companies may control significant market share in their own countries.",C,"To determine which industry is least likely to be very concentrated on a global scale, we need to consider factors that contribute to industry concentration. - Industry concentration refers to the degree to which a small number of firms dominate the market. - Industries with high barriers to entry, limited competition, and economies of scale are more likely to be concentrated. - Industries that are highly regulated or require significant capital investment are also more likely to be concentrated. - Industries that are less likely to be concentrated are those with low barriers to entry, high competition, and limited economies of scale. - Additionally, industries that are fragmented or have a large number of small players are less likely to be concentrated. - Based on these factors, the industry least likely to be very concentrated on a global scale is likely to be one that has low barriers to entry, high competition, limited economies of scale, and a large number of small players.",no
Which of the following types of indices most likely requires frequent rebalancing?,A. Equal weighted,B. Market cap weighted,C. Price weighted,A, Equal weighted indices must be rebalanced whenever the relative prices of constituent securities change.,A,"To determine which type of index requires frequent rebalancing, we need to understand what rebalancing means in the context of indices. - Rebalancing refers to adjusting the weights of the components in an index to maintain the desired representation of the underlying market or sector. - There are different types of indices, such as market-cap weighted, equal-weighted, and factor-based indices. - Market-cap weighted indices assign weights to components based on their market capitalization, while equal-weighted indices assign equal weights to all components. - Factor-based indices use specific factors, such as value or momentum, to determine the weights of the components. - Based on this information, market-cap weighted indices are more likely to require frequent rebalancing. - This is because the market capitalization of companies can change frequently due to stock price movements and new issuances of shares. - As a result, the weights of the components in a market-cap weighted index need to be adjusted regularly to reflect the changes in market capitalization. - On the other hand, equal-weighted indices do not require frequent rebalancing as the weights of the components remain constant over time. - Factor-based indices may require rebalancing if the factors used to determine the weights change or if the weights need to be adjusted to maintain the desired factor exposure. - Therefore, the most likely type of index to require frequent rebalancing is a market-cap weighted index.",yes
